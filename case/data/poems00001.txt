These hills are sandy. Trees are dwarfed here. Crows Caw dismally in skies of an arid brilliance, Complain in dusty pine-trees. Yellow daybreak Lights on the long brown slopes a frost-like dew, Dew as heavy as rain; the rabbit tracks Show sharply in it, as they might in snow. But it’s soon gone in the sun—what good does it do? The houses, on the slope, or among brown trees, Are grey and shrivelled. And the men who live here Are small and withered, spider-like, with large eyes. Bring water with you if you come to live here— Cold tinkling cisterns, or else wells so deep That one looks down to Ganges or Himalayas. Yes, and bring mountains with you, white, moon-bearing, Mountains of ice. You will have need of these Profundities and peaks of wet and cold. Bring also, in a cage of wire or osier, Birds of a golden colour, who will sing Of leaves that do not wither, watery fruits That heavily hang on long melodious boughs In the blue-silver forests of deep valleys. I have now been here—how many years? Years unnumbered. My hands grow clawlike. My eyes are large and starved. I brought no bird with me, I have no cistern Where I might find the moon, or river, or snow. Some day, for lack of these, I’ll spin a web Between two dusty pine-tree tops, and hang there Face downward, like a spider, blown as lightly As ghost of leaf. Crows will caw about me. Morning and evening I shall drink the dew.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Goya drew a pig on a wall. The five-year-old hairdresser’s son Saw, graved on a silver tray, The lion; and sunsets were begun. Goya smelt the bull-fight blood. The pupil of the Carmelite Gave his hands to a goldsmith, learned To gild an aureole aright. Goya saw the Puzzel’s eyes: Sang in the street (with a guitar) And climbed the balcony; but Keats (Under the halyards) wrote ‘Bright star.’ Goya saw the Great Slut pick The chirping human puppets up, And laugh, with pendulous mountain lip, And drown them in a coffee cup; Or squeeze their little juices out In arid hands, insensitive, To make them gibber . . . Goya went Among the catacombs to live. He saw gross Ronyons of the air, Harelipped and goitered, raped in flight By hairless pimps, umbrella-winged: Tumult above Madrid at night. He heard the seconds in his clock Crack like seeds, divulge, and pour Abysmal filth of Nothingness Between the pendulum and the floor: Torrents of dead veins, rotted cells, Tonsils decayed, and fingernails: Dead hair, dead fur, dead claws, dead skin: Nostrils and lids; and cauls and veils; And eyes that still, in death, remained (Unlidded and unlashed) aware Of the foul core, and, fouler yet, The region worm that ravins there. Stench flowed out of the second’s tick. And Goya swam with it through Space, Sweating the fetor from his limbs, And stared upon the unfeatured face That did not see, and sheltered naught, But was, and is. The second gone, Goya returned, and drew the face; And scrawled beneath it, ‘This I have known’ . . . And drew four slatterns, in an attic, Heavy, with heads on arms, asleep: And underscribed it, ‘Let them slumber, Who, if they woke, could only weep’ . . .@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Absolute zero: the locust sings: summer’s caught in eternity’s rings: the rock explodes, the planet dies, we shovel up our verities. The razor rasps across the face and in the glass our fleeting race lit by infinity’s lightning wink under the thunder tries to think. In this frail gourd the granite pours the timeless howls like all outdoors the sensuous moment builds a wall open as wind, no wall at all: while still obedient to valves and knobs the vascular jukebox throbs and sobs expounding hope propounding yearning proposing love, but never learning or only learning at zero’s gate like summer’s locust the final hate formless ice on a formless plain that was and is and comes again.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The house in Broad Street, red brick, with nine rooms the weedgrown graveyard with its rows of tombs the jail from which imprisoned faces grinned at stiff palmettos flashing in the wind the engine-house, with engines, and a tank in which young alligators swam and stank, the bell-tower, of red iron, where the bell gonged of the fires in a tone from hell magnolia trees with whitehot torch of bud the yellow river between banks of mud the tall striped lighthouse like a barber’s pole snake in the bog and locust in the hole worn cigarette cards, of white battleships, or flags, or chorus girls with scarlet lips, jackstones of copper, peach tree in the yard splashing ripe peaches on an earth baked hard children beneath the arc-light in a romp with Run sheep Run, and rice-birds in the swamp, the organ-grinder’s monkey, dancing bears, okras in baskets, Psyche on the stairs— and then the north star nearer, and the snow silent between the now and long ago time like a train that roared from place to place new crowds, new faces, for a single face no longer then the chinaberry tree nor the dark mockingbird to sing his glee nor prawns nor catfish; icicles instead and Indian-pipes, and cider in the shed arbutus under pinewoods in the spring and death remembered as a tropic thing with picture postcard angels to upraise it and trumpet vines and hummingbirds to phrase it then wisdom come, and Shakspere’s voice far off, to be or not, upon the teacher’s cough, the latent heat of melting ice, the brief hypotenuse from ecstasy to griefamo amas, and then the cras amet, the new-found eyes no slumber could forget, Vivien, the affliction of the senses, and conjugation of historic tenses and Shakspere nearer come, and louder heard, and the disparateness of flesh and word, time growing swifter, and the pendulums in shorter savage arcs that beat like drums— hands held, relinquished, faces come and gone, kissed and forgotten, and become but one, old shoes worn out, and new ones bought, the gloves soiled, and so lost in limbo, like the loves— then Shakspere in the heart, the instant speech parting the conscious terrors each from each— wisdom’s dishevelment, the purpose lamed, and purposeless the footsteps eastward aimed the bloodstream always slower, while the clock followed the tired heart with louder knock, fatigue upon the eye, the tardy springs inviting to no longer longed-for things— the birdsong nearer now than Shakspere’s voice, whispers of comfort—Death is near, rejoice!— remember now the red house with nine rooms the graveyard with its trumpetvines and tombs— play jackstones now and let your jackstones be the stars that make Orion’s galaxy so to deceive yourself until you move into that house whose tenants do not love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I’ve always worried about you—the man or woman at the piano bench, night after night receiving only such applause as the singer allows: a warm hand please, for my accompanist. At concerts, as I watch your fingers on the keys, and how swiftly, how excellently you turn sheet music pages, track the singer’s notes, cover the singer’s flaws, I worry about whole lifetimes, most lifetimes lived in the shadows of reflected fame; but then the singer’s voice dies and there are just your last piano notes, not resentful at all, carrying us to the end, into those heartfelt cheers that spring up in little patches from a thrilled audience like sudden wildflowers bobbing in a rain of steady clapping. And I’m on my feet, also, clapping and cheering for the singer, yes, but, I think, partially likewise for you half-turned toward us, balanced on your black bench, modest, utterly well-rehearsed, still playing the part you’ve made yours.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It is pleasant, very pleasant, to sit at a wooden boothsurrounded by parrots, wheels, right-turning conch shells,the victory banner and the endless knot,the lotus, the treasure vase, the golden fishes—is this not so? Is it not pleasantto sip Tsingtao beer, or Zhujiang, or Yanjing,and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats?After we’ve drunk enough, there will be Buddhist Delight,Mongolian beef side dishes, a whole host of sauces,even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present,as well as the small ice-cream machine, lotus paste, pears,smiles and bows all around. It is pleasant, is it not,to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lotof this small strip mall beside this secondary roadand look upon the scattered cars all come to rest herelike boats in China, floating on a quiet evening tide.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Make your strokes thus: the horizontal:as a cloud that slowly drifts across the horizon;the vertical: as an ancient but strong vine stem;the dot: a falling rock;and learn to master the sheep leg, the tiger’s claw,an apricot kernel, a dewdrop, the new moon,the wave rising and falling. Do thesewhile holding your arm out above the paperlike the outstretched leg of a crane.The strength of your handwill give the stroke its bone.But for real accomplishment, it would be wellif you would go to live solitary in a forest silence,or beside a river flowing serenely.It might also be usefulto look down a lonesome road,and for the futureto stare into the gray static of a television screen,or when lost in a video gameto accept you may never reach the final level,where the dragon awaits, guarding the pot of gold,and that you’ve left no footprints, not a single one,despite all your adventures,anyone following you could ever follow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Stumps. Railroad tracks. Early sicknesses, the blue one, especially. Your first love rounding a corner, that snowy minefield. Whether you step lightly or heavily, you have to get over to that tree line a hundred yards in the distance before evening falls, letting no one see you wend your way, that wonderful, old-fashioned word, wend, meaning “to proceed, to journey, to travel from one place to another,” as from bed to breakfast, breakfast to imbecile work. You have to get over your resentments, the sun in the morning and the moon at night, all those shadows of yourself you left behind on odd little tables. Tote that barge! Lift that bale! You have to cross that river, jump that hedge, surmount that slogan, crawl over this ego or that eros, then hoist yourself up onto that yonder mountain. Another old-fashioned word, yonder, meaning “that indicated place, somewhere generally seen or just beyond sight.” If you would recover, you have to get over the shattered autos in the backwoods lot to that bridge in the darkness where the sentinels stand guarding the border with their half-slung rifles, warned of the likes of you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Three years, Huang Gongwang worked on his famous handscroll,Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.As he put successive applications of ink to paperover the “one burst of creation,” his original design,it is said he often sang like a tree frogand danced on his old bare feet.One day, he adds one hemp fiber stroke,the next a moss dot.What patience he had,like a cat who comes back season after season to a mole’s tunnel.Honors may go to others.Riches may go to others.Huang Gongwang has one great job to do.And he sings like a tree frog,and he dances on old bare feet.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Birdsongs that sound like the steady determined tapping of a shoemaker's hammer, or of a sculptor making tiny ball-peen dents in a silver plate, wake me this morning. Is it possible the world itself can be happy? The calico cat stretches her long body out across the top of my computer monitor, yawning, its little primitive head a cave of possibility. And I'm ready again to try and see accidents, the over and over patterns of double-slit experiments a billionfold repeated before me. If I had great patience, I could try to count the poplar, birch and oak leaves in their shifting welter outside my bedroom window or the almost infinitesimal trails of thought that flash and flash everywhere, as if decaying particles inside a bubble chamber, windshield raindrops, lake ripples. However, instead I go to fry some bacon, crack two eggs into the cast-iron skillet that's even older than this house, and on the calendar (each month another oriental fan where the climbing solitary is dwarfed . . . or on dark blue oceans minuscular fishing boats bob beneath gigantic waves) X out the days, including those I've forgotten.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

At my side the Demon writhes forever,Swimming around me like impalpable air;As I breathe, he burns my lungs like feverAnd fills me with an eternal guilty desire.Knowing my love of Art, he snares my senses,Apearing in woman's most seductive forms,And, under the sneak's plausible pretenses,Lips grow accustomed to his lewd love-charms.He leads me thus, far from the sight of God,Panting and broken with fatigue intoThe wilderness of Ennui, deserted and broad,And into my bewildered eyes he throwsVisions of festering wounds and filthy clothes,And all Destruction's bloody retinue.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My dear, your eyes are weary;Rest them a little while.Assume the languid postureOf pleasure mixed with guile.Outside the talkative fountainContinues night and dayRepeating my warm passionIn whatever it has to say. The sheer luminous gown The fountain wears Where Phoebe’s very own Color appears Falls like a summer rain Or shawl of tears.Thus your soul ignitedBy pleasure’s lusts and needsSprays into heaven’s reachesAnd dreams of fiery deeds.Then it brims over, dying, And languorous, apart,Drains down some slope and entersThe dark well of my heart.

In the muddy maze of some old neighborhood,Often, where the street lamp gleams like blood,As the wind whips the flame, rattles the glass,Where human beings ferment in a stormy mass,One sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls,Paying no heed to the spies of the cops, his thralls,But stumbling like a poet lost in dreams;He pours his heart out in stupendous schemes.He takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws,Casts down the wicked, aids the victims' cause;Beneath the sky, like a vast canopy,He is drunken of his splendid qualities.Yes, these people, plagued by household cares,Bruised by hard work, tormented by their years,Each bent double by the junk he carries,The jumbled vomit of enormous Paris,—They come back, perfumed with the smell of staleWine-barrels, followed by old comrades, paleFrom war, mustaches like limp flags, to marchWith banners, flowers, through the triumphal archErected for them, by some magic touch!And in the dazzling, deafening debauchOf bugles, sunlight, of huzzas and drum,Bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home!Even so, wine pours its gold to frivolousHumanity, a shining Pactolus;Then through man's throat of high exploits it singsAnd by its gifts reigns like authentic kings.To lull these wretches' sloth and drown the hateOf all who mutely die, compassionate,God has created sleep's oblivion;Man added Wine, divine child of the Sun.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

These black shapes in the snow?If there is a word for them, it’s no word I know. Pursuit?, no. Proof?, no. Don’t call it fear.Could I cross this white sheet if I were coward,Edge to edge, margin to margin, neverReferring to anything outside itself?—Stop that. Stop pointing to the photo on the shelf.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
To make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyes—No, dams the eyes. See how they overflow?No damns them, damns them, and so they cry.What shape can I swallow to make me whole?Baby’s bird-shaped block, blue-painted woodThat fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?The skeleton leaf? The skeleton key? LoudKnock when the shape won’t unlock any locks.I hear it through the static in the baby’s roomWhen the monitor clicks on and off, soundOf sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,Laughing gull in the gale. What is it dives downPast sight, down there dark with the other blocks?It can’t be seen, only heard. A kind of curse,This kind curse. Forgive me. Blessing that hurts.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Posterity, this me is Now— Record this Now. Virginia, 1705 Not always settled. I am settled Over history’s yellow pages, blank Pages, must I write my old dark Thoughts: Does time mask or unmask Mind? This sweet almond now In my mouth as in their mouths Then, sweet in its rind, but silent I think: I am blood at oak, my hand A blood petal unfurled over oak, My desk, my wooded den, a pistil, A pen. Believe me: I speak honest And true.First. Economy ravishing and jealous In woods, the virgin woods. Sap is sweet so sap quarrels On the tongue. What is worth Worth? Sap sweet so sap ambers; In the virgin woods none can cut The profit from the tongue. Amber Gold so gold whispers at the edge Of each, our minds. The Natives Wear skins on skin; the women Bare their breasts and do not Blush. Was she a King’s daughter? She walked below the branches; The sun thin in silken lines The sated spiders left. Her brothers Showed us what seeds to sow. Glass beads contain light, a miracle To trade. Her skin a syrup Tone, the beads gold against her Wrist glowed. Midnight her crown Of hair plaited with one strand Of gold, thin as day’s edge when dusk Both dulls and hones that glow. “We’ll barter it.” Her brother feels Cheated when we offer a bolt Less of wool than he asks. Write it Down. Profit in black ink. They close Their eyes, quick as bark blinks Down dark on axe’s silver bite, When the deal is done. The ledger’s Honest, “I am a liar. Be aware.”Then. Pluck the withered gold at hand, The pumpkin leaves yellow, Sere and dust. Neglect the acre. Let the green aphids multiply And suck. We teethed our vision: A yellow sort of isinglass dust, Sunlit in silt, under the water Of our stream. The squash blossom Closed its eye; we squinted to see Beneath the stream. That summer We fed our hearts on dust. We grew Dust in gardens. We grew rich Until the gold sheen disclosed It was but gilded dust. We lived Some time on mussel, crab, berry, Those fruits of the wild earth. No one Spoke the word “starving.” We were Forced to be content with what fell Just in our mouths.Earlier Than First. Thought in the forest speaks A wooden chorus. My own voice Multiplied the almond by the pine.Roanoke, 1588. Repaired the houses Now grown up with weeds. We make wooden houses. How quiet One voice, mumbling verses out The wilderness, by the fire In the corner. Bibles clothed in skin As the Natives come clothed. Exodus A comfort: to be chosen, safe, God spoke in smoke by day, in light By night. A manna faith—of manna. When Mr. White arrived, late August 1590, he went to search for us. Found Weeds grown among the wood Homes. He found us removed From this land. He heard us whisper. He never heard from us again. Notes we pinned to the trees told him We moved to another Island that forms the sound (But we were not there). We live in the sound. He found Our voices pinned to the trees.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It was when they determined that I had been born dead That my life became easier to understand. For a long time, I wondered why rooms felt colder when I entered them, Why nothing I said seemed to stick in anyone’s ear, Frankly, why I never had any money. I wondered Why the cities I walked through drifted into cloud Even as I admired their architecture, as I pointed out The cornerstones marked “1820,” “1950.” The only songs I ever loved were filled with scratch, dispatches from A time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen. I spent my life in hotels: some looked like mansions, Some more like trailer parks, or pathways toward A future I tried to point to, but how could I point, With nothing but a hand no hand ever matched, With fingers that melted into words that no one read. I rehearsed names that others taught me: Caravaggio, Robert Brandom, Judith, Amber, Emmanuelle Cat. I got hungry the way only the dead get hungry, The hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars, But I never took part in the wars, because no one lets A dead man into their covert discussions. So I drifted from loft to cellar, ageless like a ghost, And America became my compass, and Europe became The way that dead folks talk, in short, who cares, There’s nothing to say because nobody listens, There’s no radio for the dead and the pillows seem Like sand. Let me explain: when you’re alive, As I understand it, pillows cushion the head, the way A lover might soothe the heart. The way it works for me, In contrast, is everything is sand. Beds are sand, The women I profess to love are sand, the sound of music In the darkest night is sand, and whatever I have to say Is sand. This is not, for example, a political poem, Because the dead have no politics. They might have A hunger, but nothing you’ve ever known Could begin to assuage it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Snow will fall, day turn to night, and not even postmen evade her sight, Lidless, fulfilling the ancient dream, she sees the tanks roll into Gaza And dieters, she sees with all-encompassing eyes the shredding of orders, Kids sneaking into The Story of O, the football scrimmage, and Manhattan Ending, she sees the end of Paris and Fort Worth, she watches subways melt Sleeplessly, she knew how it all would work out, she trains her dials on the death Of kings sitting sadly by the waterfront shacks, she sees beyond the genius Of Edwards Teller, Hopper, and Lear. You and I are the trouble she’s seen. Mary, wouldn’t you like to come outside? Mary, Mary, when will you come outside? ** The sky was black. The sky was blue. I was sitting someplace. I saw it. ** The community got together, as communities will, And waited together for death. Some of us Were colorblind, so when they lifted the red flag To signal the drink, we had to be prodded By neighbors. In a couple of cases, There were clusters of the colorblind, after all A genetic trait: these familial bands Required repeated prodding by strangers On the outskirts. It produced a wavelike pattern, All this prodding, so that to an outside observer, One tuning in from remote satellite, for example, It was reminiscent of a Busby Berkeley scene, Or one of those marching band routines In which the scrambling about of the sousaphone players Suddenly blossoms into a starfish or some kind of Risqué joke. But within fifteen minutes or so, The prodding subsided, and after that the drinking, The twitching, and we all lay dead in the field. ** After she emerged, she saw red, and it was red. She emerged, and saw yellow. She saw blue. After she emerged, she saw what green was like. She saw purple and orange and gray.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The water is only water because it’s black. 5:15 a.m. Perhaps you’ve seen me practicing my moves in the empty prison yard and wondered whether you were the dreamer conjuring me into existence from the bare desire to caress a phantom ship and my death the death of your desire.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I. THE FUNERAL MARCH (CHICAGO AND ORLEANS) Once more in the city I cannot name, the boat city, the city of light, the city that endures its fall, the city of pleasures and vicissitudes, the skier’s city, Fun City, the city under the sky, city of crime and vegetables, Pornograph City, the city governed by the Lost and Found Department, cabinet city, city of the bends, the opium city, Swing City, Archetype City, city of dust, city that eludes the seven ages, muskrat city, the island city of daughters and wives, Sin City, city of sincerity, the cavernous city, the city of conventions, hatmaker city, Alphabet City, city of the last and first, the city called Marrakesh (I know it is not Marrkesh), industrial city, the city of airplane booze, center city, the city without shoulders, the city that forgot, the trampoline city, Abacus City, the city of tears, the real city (or the city of the desert), the unreal city (or the city of good will), the city of rust, of showers, of late blooming aster, Hygiene City, the city of logistics— once more in the city called Halloween (I know it is not Halloween), I gathered the five true ingredients of gunpowder and arranged to meet my younger brother Stetson next noon at the Heartland Cafe. Why do you walk with your face turned from me? All you do is complain and complain. What is this thing called love? It is nothing reliable, not like this silk cravat on which tiny turtles hover suspended against an amber background. The knot needs to be loosened. Night has come. I walk in the garden amid the late-blooming roses and guard my glass from the moon. This morning the police came for me. They brought a letter covered with signs I could not decipher. They demanded I register my address properly, because they are sorely tested by the time’s demands and cannot function as my delivery service. I met their angry gazes with a sigh, and I proclaimed: “April is the coolest month, which brings happy policeman the pleasant dreams of spring.” They still refused to answer my questions. I know my life is in terrible danger. What is this thing called love? II. DON’T LOOK BACK A degree or two to the right of an imagined meridian marking time’s monotonous ecliptic tracing and retracing the animal steps that bring the man down narrow hallways, a painting hangs, depicting an almond tree in blossom, unfurling white petals against a deepening green, brown brushstrokes scarring the field, and in the center of the decentered vista, a fleck of canvas erupts through the paint, as when air thrusts itself to fill a vacuum, or after galactic gyrations the light of a now-cold star reveals itself to us and breaks the settled pattern of the sky. For if the tree implies a quiet place where pendulums might rest, the heart decline to beat, a place of time disclosing the lattice of time, each node identical, complete within itself, its infinite simplicity sufficient to lure the mind out of its droning dream of traffic, footstools, marzipan, and clouds back to itself, if the tree must be a sign of the viewer’s hunger to escape from signs and thereby lose the world, the tiny scar unmakes the fiction that sustains the tree, the way a cashier’s knowing jibe at the record you had waited weeks to buy, recommended to you by a woman you barely know who mentioned it in passing, then returned to her diatribe against the host who failed to invite her boyfriend or her companion’s boyfriend— you had only half been listening until she said, “It sounds like nothing else, not like the wind or ocean, not even like the early Pixies, though it has that effect on you, something like getting a letter addressed to someone else that ends up addressed to you, in that reading it with a proper sense of shame throws your devotion to formalities completely out the window.

The first great poet of the crisis the one whose generation was left as if firebombed though if you look back at the seminal work you will see that only a handful of of the poems explicitly touch on that dark time the blood filling with virulence and the night always black and spangled with stars says when faced with difficult material the poet should begin obliquely creeping in from the edge a square of light moving imperceptibly across the floor as the earth turns and so I will tell you that ever since I saw the footage of the journalists hiding in the attic the rope ladder pulled up after them only the one with foreign papers left to stand her ground down below the journalist at first calmly sitting on the couch but then huddling in a cabinet as the soldiers enter the apartment next door, the cries of the mother floating through the wall ib’ni ib’ni the language ancient like something whetted on stone the way I image language would have sounded in the broken mouth of King DavidAbsalom Absalom the man-child hanging by the shining black noose of his own hair in the fragrant woods of Ephraim ib’ni ib’ni next door the sound of a body being dragged from the apartment as his mother wails into the dark how many mothers and how many sons dragged out into a night spangled with stars where everything is a metaphor for virulence my son my son and ever since I saw a clip of the footage the foreign journalist managed to smuggle out of the country images of the journalist herself hiding in a space meant for buckets and rags as next door the soldiers drag away a young boy please hear it again a child of no more than twelve his mother’s lamentations forever seared in the blood of this thing I call my life but really what is it what is this light I hold so dear it wants to move imperceptibly across the floor as the earth turns so as not to become too aware of itself?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the delicateness needless, consumable. How everything here naturally passes into night, a room w/o walls. Could mindlessness keep us alive? Could bright colors? Tonight I am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her father being shot in the head. Imagine needing to believe the one you love has been destroyed. Now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. Here alone on deck could I make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent rising, the gasping for air? I have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness— but I too am such things. What does it mean to be eroded? What would be the significance of slipping one leg over the rail & straddling the indifference? Yes. Once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of Kobé, Japan. All night the waves. All night the somnambulistic urges. Or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged & torn, but underneath the roots of the water lilies like ladders trailing down into the marvelous.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I have come to realize the body is its own pyre, that degree rises from within, the fatty acids a kind of kindling. Like a scientist in a lab, this much I have established, blood jelled like gasoline, the years spread before me like a map pinned with targets, where I’m raging even now. It works both ways. Clear the forests to see your enemies and your enemies see you clearly. Like all effective incendiaries, I won’t only bloom where I’m planted.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Shagged-gold, at rest the great haunches as if axled, fur sleeked like a butter rug. In the Serengeti sun, the male’s harem like a solar system, each lady kept exclusive, her seasonal heat for him alone, estrous belly pressed to the ground, then the male’s riding her musculature— throughout evolution the cat’s barbed penis nicking his breached mate as he dismounts. See the deliberate walk, cool as a criminal, the multi-jointed forepaws placed consciously even by the usurped king, his eye teeth blacked, his tail rotted off, tired wag of a bloody stump as he finally falls dying, the crucified face bedded in its wheel of hair, the tawny miscegenated eyes binocular in breadth. Shark in the long grasses. Shark in the long grass. Smell everywhere, the gazelle with its small-headed splendor gracing the plains is ambushed, devoured, its horned bone rack souvenired, the murderer’s ripping muzzle crimsoned. In the despot’s sons’ palace of pure gold the three in the iron cage lazing like statues. When the American unlocks the hinged door our shackled hearts contract. Unhooded and naked we are pushed into their presence, and for a shining moment the animals study us, these fabulous aliens. Here in a desert captivity snatched from the baobab’s sour fruit, their swagged bellies shifted, broken, and resignedly the ancient drive rose up only in one— its head wreathed beyond sorrow as it slouched out of the habitual darkness, the permanent rictus of its terrible mouth pain-struck. The thing came toward me with its ruined light, and I saw affliction in it. Dream of mastery. Dream of being wholly consumed, freed. I am the lion and the lion is me. Then the American pulls us out.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Listen closely as I sing this. The man standing at the gate tottering on his remaining limb is a kind of metronome, his one leg planted firmly on the earth. Yes, I have made him beautiful because I aim to lay all my cards on the table. In the book review the critic writes, “Barry seeks not to judge but to understand.” Did she want us to let her be, or does she want to be there walking the grounds of the old prison on the hill of the poison tree where comparatively a paltry twenty thousand died? In the first room with the blown up black-and-white of a human body gone abstract someone has to turn and face the wall not because of the human pain represented in the photo but because of her calmness, the tranquility with which she tells us that her father and her sister and her brother were killed. In graduate school a whole workshop devoted to an image of a woman with bleach thrown in the face and the question of whether or not the author could write, “The full moon sat in the window like a calcified eye, the woman’s face aglow with a knowingness.” I felt it come over me and I couldn’t stop. I tried to pull myself together and I couldn’t. They were children. An army of child soldiers. In the room papered with photos of the Khmer Rouge picture after picture of teenagers, children whose parents were killed so that they would be left alone in the world to do the grisly work that precedes paradise. And the photos of the victims, the woman holding her newborn in her arms as her head is positioned in a vise, in this case the vise an instrument not of torture but of documentation, the head held still as the camera captures the image, the thing linking all their faces, the abject fear and total hopelessness as exists in only a handful of places in the history of the visible world. For three $US per person she will guide you through what was Tuol Sleng prison, hill of the strychnine tree. Without any affectation she will tell you the story of how her father and her sister and her brother went among the two million dead. There are seventy-four forms of poetry in this country and each one is still meant to be sung.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Say, when we woke those icy spring mornings they were still there. The upper portion of their faces long ruined but you could still see the meaning in their hands, palms once covered in gold. We knew better than to call them by their names, Light that Shines Throughout the Universe and His consort, but there were stories of travelers lost in the foothills of the Hindu Kush and a distant brilliance that led them home. The way a candle physically enters your body after it has been snuffed out. The pearly smoke suffused in the air. In one school hundreds of miles away all the girls my age were poisoned, and last week outside the capital a woman like my sister was shot dead in front of a crowd by two men who forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidel so they could kill her and be done with it. After the visitors were blasted I had a dream. I saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at him directly. His image on the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world. In my dream the man said, “Thousands of lifetimes ago when my body was cut into pieces by an evil king, I was not caught up in the idea of the self.” Then in my dream someone picked up a rock and I woke up. It took almost a month, the great heads drilled with holes, then anti-aircraft tanks rolled in. Each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us, like a person. Before it happened we talked about it. Grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven? Second Aunt said it was more realistic this way. God not in heaven but in exile.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Somebody says draw a map. Populate it with the incidents of your childhood. Mark the spot where the lake receded after a winter of light snow. The stairs on which someone slapped you. The place where the family dog hung itself by jumping over the back fence while still on the dog run, hours later its body like a limp flag on a windless day. Draw a map, someone says. Let yourself remember. In the refugee camp a hundred thousand strong draw the stony outcrop from which you could no longer see the plume of smoke that was your village. Draw a square for the bathroom stall where Grandpa hid each day in order to eat his one egg free from the starving eyes of his classmates, an X for the courthouse where you and he were naturalized, a broken line for the journey. Draw a map, Jon says. Let it be your way into the poem. Here is where that plane filled with babies crashed that I was not on. Here is where I was ashamed. On the second floor at Pranash University the people wait their turn. Have you drawn your map, Jon asks. He has rolled up his sleeves. Forty-five minutes to noon the Prince stands up and says that the monks must be excused. We watch them file out, saffron robes as if their bodies have burst into blossom. Draw a map. Fly halfway around the globe. Here is the room next to the library where you realize how poor your tradition is, the local people with poetic forms still in use that date back to the time of Christ. Tell us about your map. Explain how these wavy lines represent the river, this rectangle the school-turned-prison where only seven escaped with their lives. This is my map. This star the place where I sat in a roomful of people among whom not one was not touched by genocide. Every last map resplendent with death though nobody knows where their loved ones lie buried. How many times can I appropriate a story that is not mine to tell? The woman stands up and says she is not a poet, that she doesn’t have the words. She points to a triangle on a piece of paper. Here is the spot where she found human bones in the well of her childhood home, and how her mother told herdon’t be afraid because it was not the work of wild animals.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Nowhere in the Halakha’s five thousand years of rules does it specifically state Thou shall not [ ] but sometimes tradition carries more weight than law and so for much of the past year we have not talked about what will happen on Thursday, how the cervix will start its slow yawn, the pelvic floor straining as the head crowns, the fontanelles allowing the bony panes of the skull to pass through until, over the next 24 months, the five cranial plates gradually ossify, the head forming its own helmet as structures harden over the soft meats of the brain, nor do we talk about the colostrum sunny as egg yolks now collecting in your breasts, the thing’s first nutrients already ready and waiting, the event just days away and still we do not talk about it, the mass growing inside you tucked up safe in the leeward side under the heart because sometimes our god is a jealous god, the evil eye lidless and all-seeing. Instead we will wait until it is done, until the creature has been cleaned and wrapped in soft cloth, the bloody cord that binds you severed. And maybe you will name it Dolores, which means grief, or perhaps you will call it Mara, the Hebrew name for bitterness because this is how we protect what we love, by hiding what it truly means to us, the little bag of gold we keep buried in the yard, the thing we will do anything to keep safe, even going so far as to pretend it doesn’t exist, that there’s nothing massing in the dark despite the steady light emanating from your face, a radiance so bright sometimes I can’t look at you, the joy so overpowering you want to shout it from the highest mountaintop straight into God’s ear.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Literally the thing has been gutted, a ragged gash carved under its tail to midway up its chest, eyes like stagnant water, horns intricate as a woodwind. Where did the viscera go? Where do the viscera ever go? I am in a car driving to the northernmost point on this spit. Porte de Mort. Death’s Northern Door. Literally where my grandmother lives. Her 89-year-old cousin has just fallen out a window but is all right, the bruises like stained glass. Enthusiasm. To be in God. My grandmother says it is proof, and I nod my head because I too would like to live in such a world where an eighty-nine year old crawls out a window and falls seven feet to the ground, in turn the miracle of her body stained a deep blue, vitreous. In one room of the unfinished mansion where we will celebrate the day, the ninety-year-old matriarch sleeps in her four-poster bed under the canopy of a wedding dress, its hundred eyelets a fallacy. After dinner someone will hand around an indulgence of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, the lady’s dark cheek marred as if she has been scratched. Who at this table fled the police? Who left that place in flames, the rubble of infinite hearths? The deer’s eyes like perfect cataracts, the evidence cooling. When I think of my room in the earth, I can’t breathe. A friend of a friend recently hit a small bear with his car. At the end of my favorite novel a bear is dancing on a makeshift stage, the bear a grotesquerie like the rest of us. No one stopped to help, said my friend. Traffic barely slowed. I do not judge this, or even the surreptitious footage of the workers somewhere on the killing floor, stomping the breast-heavy creatures with their rubber boots. How we raise them not to fly, what should waft gnostically through the air, the hollowness of evolving. My heart is doing that thing again, saying climb the stairs on your knees. I tell a friend a man halfway across the world has been killed, torn apart by motorbikes, each limb tied in a different direction. Could a universe be born this way? One minute you are scarping the silvery bark off a birch when it comes to you forever and there you lie in the bed of a blood-smeared truck at a stoplight on Highway 41 because this is the season of messages. The man was a teacher. He taught girls. When they came for him he told his children not to cry. Then the men took out half his bowel, the viscera steaming as they do, and they tied him ingeniously in such a way that they tore him apart. In that other place three million of us died. When I left, I left them all behind. In the unfinished mansion someone will ask me what I’m thankful for. What to say? That one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen was a paper nest secreted by wasps, and that in the summer I would sleep under it, the runnelled mass turning like a planet in the moonlight? I will admit I was in favor of war and now look what’s happened. At the end of the road the man driving the truck will eat the deer. If I had to watch someone be torn apart by motorbikes I would still be me, which is the horror of it all.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tonight we will function like women. The snow has gone away, the ice with its amniotic glare. I clasp my sister’s tiny hand. We will not turn away Though spring, spring with its black appetite, Comes seeping out of the earth. The lion was sad. He suffered us To touch him. When I placed the bread of my hands In his mammalian heat, I was reminded That the world outside this world Is all vinegar and gall, that to be a young girl at the foot of a god Requires patience. Timing. The White Witch has mustered her partisans. Because I am fascinated by her bracelets strung with baby teeth, I will remember her as the woman Who grins with her wrists. From my thicket of heather I note that in her own congenital way She is pure, that tonight she ushers something new into the world. I cannot stop it. I cannot stop it just as in that other place I could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming. Though in this closed realm the smell of camphor is overwhelming I have nothing but my hands to use In ministering to the dead. Here too My hands must suffice. Hush now while I testify. They are shaving him. The corona of his mane falls away Like pieces of money. In the moon’s milk light Her bangled wrists grin as she raises the blade. Something is diffused. In whatever world he comes again There will be women like us who choose to.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The errand into the maze, Emblem, the heel’s blow upon space, Speak of the need and order the dancer’s will. But the dance is still. For a surmise of rest, over the flight of the dial, Between shock of the fall, shock of repose, The flesh in its time delivered itself to the trial, And rose. Suffrance: the lapse, the pause, Were the will of the dance— The movement-to-be, charmed from the shifts of the chance, Intent on its cause. And the terrible gift Of the gaze, blind on its zenith, the wreath Of the throat, the body’s unwearied uplift, Unmaking and making its death, Were ripeness, and theme for return: Were rest, in the durance of matter: The sleep of the musing Begetter And the poise in the urn.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Rise, cleanly trust, divided star, And spend that delicate fraud upon the night— A lover’s instance moving mindful air To make its peace in dedicated light Whose look is charnel. Lusters, intent and blind, Give darkness downward with a glow like sheaves— A gleaner’s pittance withered in the bind That keeps the summer godhead of the leaves And bends tremendous evening under it, Doubles its theft within a lonely course Till eye and eye repeat the counterfeit And shape the replenishing mercy at its source. All else were ravage: a demon-gaze of terror: The emblem blackened in the living head, The eye, the image, and the image-bearer Struck to an awe with smiling on the dead. Therefore that bounty which, however false, Tenders survival, and is purely given, And lends the viewless prisms at its pulse To make an easy legendry in heaven.Restore that grace! Indeed, the look is grace That deals this desert providence in air And lifts a deathshead, burning, into place To serve a lover’s faith.Rise, carrion star.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the walkers-on-water went under, the bog-walkers came out of the barberry thickets, booted in gum to their hips, in a corona of midges, their ears electric with sound, beating the stale of the swamp with their whips and flailing the ground for the itch under the frond, the fern’s demonology, the mosquito’s decibel. Night-sweat clotted their palms. They tasted their gall. The sumac flickered a swatch of its leaves in the lichens and venoms, a dazzle was seen in the fog as a vegetal world gave way to a uterine, pitch pulled at their heels and blackened their knuckles, the bog-laurel’s fan opened its uttermost decimal and showed them the Bog. Paradisal, beyond purpose or menace, dewed like the flesh of an apple with the damp of creation, the disk of the pond glowed under the dragonfly’s bosses, where a faulting of glaciers had left it—vaults of bog-rosemary, buckbean and Labrador tea, a dapple of leavening mosses soaking in ice-water, peat-wicks feeding their gas to the cranberry braziers. They entered the bonfire together. The moss took their weight like a trampoline: they walked on the sponge and bitumen without leaving a footprint. In between, in the vats of mat-roses where the waterline closed like a skin, the ambiguous world of imbalance, non-being, the pre-human and tentative, was one with the ludicrous. The quaking began—under their bootsoles at first, like a whale under ambergris, then cramming their wrists with a drummer’s vibrations, knocking their ribs and their knees as all sagged and rebounded. They lurched on the wet as though tracing a profile of breakers or displacing the cords and the voids of a net, and staggered back into their childhoods, till their feet touched the granite again. The bog tossed them over the threshold that opened a path in the spruce toward the opposite edges. The leaves closed behind them. They walked an unyielding and tangible world like strangers, remembering only the hovering glare where the pitcher-plant’s hammer closed on the fly—the light shaking and shaking— as a pulse touched their feet from below, and passed over.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The orange-peelers of Mérida, in the wrought- iron midday, come with mechanical skewers and live oranges, to straddle the paths on caissons of bicycle wheels and work in the dark of the plaza, like jewelers’ cloths. The orange is ceremonious. Its sleep is Egyptian. Its golden umbilicus waits in pyramidal light, swath over swath, outwitting the Caesars. It cannot be ravaged by knives, but clasps its mortality in, like the skein of an asp. The bandstand glitters like bone, in laurel and spittle. Behind their triangular catafalques, the orange-peelers move through the thirst of the world with Rameses’ bounty caulked into the hive of the peel while ratchets and wheels spin a blazing cosmology on their little machines. Under skewers and handles, the orange’s skin is pierced, the orange, in chain-mail and papyrus, unwinds the graveclothes of Pharaoh in a helix of ribbon, unflawed, from the navel’s knot to the rind and the pulp underneath, like a butterfly’s chrysalis. And sleeper by sleeper, the living turn with their thirst to each other, the orange’s pith is broken in a blind effervescence that perfumes the palate and burns to the tooth’s bite. And the dead reawaken.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the Deluge had passed, into my head, by twos, came the creeping things, the horn of their jawbones shining, and the things of the air, wing-cases breaking like clasp knives, asking their names. Storm-light colored their passing with an animal imminence. They wheeled on the pile of their plumage, in the dread of their animal being, and rode in the ark of my head where the possible worked like a sea. Nothing was given me there. Nothing was known. Feather and scale, concussions of muscle and fur, the whale and the name for the whale rose on the void like a waterspout, being, and ceasing to be: till keel clashed and I spoke: mayfly, wood-weasel, stingray, cormorant, mole— choosing the syllables, holding a leaf to the torrent, unharmed and infallible, while Creation descended, in twos.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They splay at a bend of the road, rifles slung, the shadows minimal, their hands tugging their slings by the upper swivel to ease the routine of the march. They have been moving since morning, and over each has descended that singleness, mournful and comatose, which is the mysterious gift of the march. Their helmets shadow their eyes, their chinstraps dangling. In the raddle of grasses their solitude floats in a drift of identities, a common melancholy. A captain enters the frame at the head of his company. His face flashes. With his left hand he tilts back his helmet, while with his right he draws the length of an elbow across forehead and nose, his stained armpits showing dark. A bracelet flashes behind him. The column recedes, rifles close over the canted belts, moving up, the packed backs vulnerable:(Cut) Late afternoon. In the half-light a handful of blazing sticks, four infantrymen heating mess tins over an eddy of smoke, a fifth on his hams, his eyes upcast from the rim of his metal cup. Nearby a corporal works a patch into the chamber of his rifle; he repeats four syllables and smiles sleepily into the camera. The camera moves to the bivouac area; a group, their meat-cans close to their mouths, spooning the compost, Chinese-fashion, and clowning between mouthfuls. Very close. Their jaws, lightly bearded, the necks in their jacket collars strained in an easy horseplay, the Adam’s apples rapidly raised and released in the human exertion of eating. In deep shadow, the light failing, very close. A private tugs at his boot by the toe and the round of the heel. Deliberately, he draws the boot clear of his foot, sets it aside with deep satisfaction, massages his instep over a maternal thickness of socks. He bends toward the other foot, camera-shy, a half smile breaking;(Cut) It is not yet possible to distinguish the forms behind the camouflage netting. They move in the central darkness of the gun, stacking shells and bringing up powder charges. Only the bulk of the howitzer is sure, the gun-barrel crossing the line of the valley under the tented netting. A village is burning in the valley. In the watery light, smoke deepens over three hearthbeds of brightness. A spire. A siding. A ladder of rooftops. The gun fires. The picture trembles.(Cut) An iron darkening. The hip of a tank darkens a frame, foreshortened, the treads close to the lens, a rushing of hammers, rings. The lens is cleared. A cobbled street. A row of country-houses, walled. A rosebush in the heavy light, blown forward. Dust falls in the afterdraft, a grain at a time. The camera is watchful. A rifleman moves up the frame, his rifle at low port, his shadow buffing the cobbles, crouched. He pauses under the rosebush, his rifle hiked. A second figure breaks through the frame, freezing between the foreground and the far doorway. The man under the rosetree sights carefully. The second man listens. He raises his rifle, barrel backwards, and brings the butt down heavily on the door-panels. The rifle rebounds. He measures a second blow, his teeth bared slightly in a reflex of anxiety. His eye is large. The butt-plate smashes over doorknob and lock, the knocker flies upward once, the panel splinters all at once. The man kicks the door open easily with a booted foot. He listens, bent toward his rifle-sights. He signals to the second man and enters the doorway, stooped like a man entering a cave—(Cut) Brightness through trees. A damascene. At the edge of a clearing, a parked jeep. Two medical corpsmen lash litters to the jeep engine a few hundred yards behind front lines. The litter-poles enter the lens over the arch of the engine. On the litter, a swathed head, a shock of broken hair, motionless, a fall of blankets. The stretcher-bearers vault lightly to their seats and move off at a crawl. Roadmarker: Battalion Aid Station. A corner of charred wall, rubble, glass, timber. Legend: Épicerie. The stretcher-bearers dismount. The film is bad. Presently a gloved hand in a surgeon’s sheath, holding a forceps. Briskly the hand moves over a circlet of maimed flesh noo@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. You are here on the underside of the page, writing in water, anachronist, showing your head with its delicate fuses, its fatal telemetry, a moundful of triggers and gunpowder like a field-mine, your sixty-one inches and your gem-cutter’s fingers, anonymous, taking the weight of a “roomful of people” but making no mark, pressing the page as I write, while the traffic in Rome, demotic with engines and klaxons, circles the Pyramid of Cestius, crosses a graveyard, and submerges again like the fin of a shark. 2. I write, in the posthumous way, on the flat of a headstone with a quarrier’s ink, like yourself: an anthologist’s date and an asterisk, a parenthetical mark in the gas of the pyramid-builders, an obelisk whirling with Vespas in a poisonous motorcade. I make your surgeon’s incision for solitude—one living hand, two poets strangled in seawater and phlegm, an incestuous ego to reach for the heart in the funeral ashes, a deathbed with friends. 3. Something murderous flows from the page to my hand— a silence that wars with the letters, a fist that closes on paper: a blow with the straight edge of a razor that falls with a madman’s monotony; or the adze of a sleepwalking Sumerian nicking the wet of the clay, hacking a wedge in a tablet in the blood and the mica, till all glistens with language. The criminal folds up his claspknife. The shutters slam down on the streets. Nobody listens. 4. Out of breath with the climb, and tasting a hashish of blood, what did he see on the brink of the Piazza di Spagna? A hand in the frame of a cithara where beggars and sunbathers clotted the levels like musical signatures, a Wordsworthian dream of “degree,” “unimaginable time” touched by an axe blade—or a pram on the Steps of Odessa torn from the hands of its mother, gathering speed for the plunge and rocking its tires in the rifling, like a gun barrel, smashing its way through the Tzar’s executioners, to a scream at the bottom? 5.A failed solitude ... The bees in the Protestant grass speak of it delicately in the sweat of a Palatine summer, guiding my hand through the Braille of the letters. Violet, bluet, or squill— what was it I picked under the epitaph, what rose to my touch in the thirst of the marble, a cup from the well of your grave in the noonday miasma, a hieroglyph in the water, saying: solitude, solitude, solitude: you have it at last—your solitude writing on water, alone with its failure. 6. You are there on the underside of the page, a blue flower in my Baedeker, writing on water. I know it. The paper pulls under my pen peaks into waves running strongly into the horizon. The emptiness hardens with balustrades, risers, and levels, a staircase of Roman azaleas. I slip on the blood and the ink toward the exigent bed of a poet. All is precarious. A maniac waits on the streets. Nobody listens. What must I do? I am writing on water, blazing with failures, ascending, descending among lovers and trippers. You are pressing me hard under the paper. At Santa Trinità dei Monti the stairway parts like an estuary, rises and falls like a fountain. There is nothing to see but a death-mask, your room in an island of risers and treads, oddly gregarious, an invisible hand in the granite. 7. The tidal salts drain on a living horizon, leaving a glare on the blemishing paper. The silence is mortal. Nobody answers.for Joan Hutton Landis@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When last we came this pleasant way The hedgerows blossomed, high and hard, And blue with shade the violets lay In every cherry-lightened yard. Now, in commemorative rain, I walk the quiet way alone, And there are violets again As blue as I have ever known. Useless to barricade the flesh To splendid branch and flower-row: I see the cherry, flaked and fresh, And smell the violet as I go Perplexed past wetted flowerbed And boxwood glimmering into leaf, Companionless, disquieted, And fearfully as any thief— Smarting of some sacrilege Too profligate to understand, As one who disavows a pledge And treads repudiated land.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Bringing “only what is needed—essential toilet articles” in a paper bag, dressed as for dying, one sees the dying plainly. These are the homecomings of Agamemnon, the odysseys to the underside of the web that weaves and unweaves while the suitors gorge upon plenty and the languishing sons at home unwish their warring fathers with strong electric fingers. The fathers are failing. In the Hospital Exchange, one sees the dying plainly: color televisions, beach towels, automatic razors— the hardware of the affluent society marked down to cost, to match the negative afflatus of the ailing, the bandages and badges of their status. Under the sandbags, rubber hoses, pipettes, bed-clamps, tax-exempt, amenable as rabbits, the unenlisted men are bleeding through their noses in a perimeter of ramps and apparatus. In that prosthetic world, the Solarium lights up a junk-pile of used parts: the hip that caught a ricochet of shrapnel; tattoos in curing meats; scars like fizzled fuses; canceled postage stamps; automated claws in candy; the Laser’s edge; and barium. The nurses pass like mowers, dressing and undressing in the razor-sharp incisions and the flowering phosphorescence. The smell of rubbing alcohol rises on desertions and deprivals and divorces. It is incorruptible. A wheelchair aims its hospital pajamas like a gun-emplacement. The amputee is swinging in his aviary. His fingers walk the bird-bars. There is singing from the ward room—a buzzing of transistors like blueflies in a urinal. War over war, the expendables of Metz and Chateau-Thierry, the guerillas of Bien Hoa and Korea, the draftees, the Reserves, the re-enlisters, open a common wavelength. The catatonic sons are revving up their combos in the era of the angry adolescent. Their cry is electronic. Their thumbs are armed with picks. The acid-rock guitarist in metal studs and chevrons, bombed with magnesium, mourns like a country yokel, and the innocents are slaughtered. On the terrace, there are juices and bananas. The convalescent listens to his heartbeat. The chaplain and his non-combative daughter smile by the clubbed plants on the portico.“They shall overcome.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

From the porch at dusk I watched a kingfisher wild in flight he could only have made for joy. He came down the river, splashing against the water’s dimming face like a skipped rock, passing on down out of sight. And still I could hear the splashes farther and farther away as it grew darker. He came back the same way, dusky as his shadow, sudden beyond the willows. The splashes went on out of hearing. It was dark then. Somewhere the night had accommodated him —at the place he was headed for or where, led by his delight, he came.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If you are not to become a monster, you must care what they think. If you care what they think, how will you not hate them, and so become a monster of the opposite kind? From where then is love to come—love for your enemy that is the way of liberty? From forgiveness. Forgiven, they go free of you, and you of them; they are to you as sunlight on a green branch. You must not think of them again, except as monsters like yourself, pitiable because unforgiving.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
i Make a place to sit down. Sit down. Be quiet. You must depend upon affection, reading, knowledge, skill—more of each than you have—inspiration, work, growing older, patience, for patience joins time to eternity. Any readers who like your poems, doubt their judgment. ii Breathe with unconditional breath the unconditioned air. Shun electric wire. Communicate slowly. Live a three-dimensioned life; stay away from screens. Stay away from anything that obscures the place it is in. There are no unsacred places; there are only sacred places and desecrated places. iii Accept what comes from silence. Make the best you can of it. Of the little words that come out of the silence, like prayers prayed back to the one who prays, make a poem that does not disturb the silence from which it came.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They sit together on the porch, the dark Almost fallen, the house behind them dark. Their supper done with, they have washed and dried The dishes–only two plates now, two glasses, Two knives, two forks, two spoons–small work for two.

Once there was a man who filmed his vacation. He went flying down the river in his boat with his video camera to his eye, making a moving picture of the moving river upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly toward the end of his vacation. He showed his vacation to his camera, which pictured it, preserving it forever: the river, the trees, the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat behind which he stood with his camera preserving his vacation even as he was having it so that after he had had it he would still have it. It would be there. With a flick of a switch, there it would be. But he would not be in it. He would never be in it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks.All but the youngest; she in paleness sought the secret air. To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day: Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard: And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew. O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall. Ah! Thel is like a watry bow. and like a parting cloud. Like a reflection in a glass. like shadows in the water. Like dreams of infants. like a smile upon an infants face, Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air; Ah! gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my head, And gentle sleep the sleep of death. and gentle hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass Answer'd the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed, And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales; So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head. Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all. Walks in the valley. and each morn over me spreads his hand Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lilly flower, Thou gentle maid of silent valleys. and of modest brooks; For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna: Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal vales: then why should Thel complain, Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh. She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine. Thel answered. O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley. Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'ertired. Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments, He crops thy flowers. while thou sittest smiling in his face, Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints. Thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume, Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs, Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed. But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun: I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?\" \"Queen of the vales,\" the Lily answered, \"ask the tender cloud, And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky, And why it scatters its bright beauty thro' the humid air. Descend, O little cloud, & hover before the eyes of Thel.\" The Cloud descended, and the Lily bowd her modest head, And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass. II \"O little Cloud,\" the virgin said, \"I charge thee tell to me, Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away: Then we shall seek thee but not find; ah, Thel is like to Thee. I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.\" The Cloud then shew'd his golden head & his bright form emerg'd, Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel. \"O virgin, know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs Where Luvah doth renew his horses? Look'st thou on my youth, And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more, Nothing remains? O maid, I tell thee, when I pass away, It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy: Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers, And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent: The weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun, Till we arise link'd in a golden band, and never part, But walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers.\" \"Dost thou O little Cloud? I fear that I am not like thee; For I walk through the vales of Har and smell the sweetest flowers, But I feed not the little flowers; I hear the warbling birds, But I feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their food; But Thel delights in these no more, because I fade away, And all shall say, 'Without a use this shining woman liv'd, Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms?'\" The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer'd thus: \"Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A little black thing among the snow, Crying \"weep! 'weep!\" in notes of woe! \"Where are thy father and mother? say?\" \"They are both gone up to the church to pray. Because I was happy upon the heath, And smil'd among the winter's snow, They clothed me in the clothes of death, And taught me to sing the notes of woe. And because I am happy and dance and sing, They think they have done me no injury, And are gone to praise God and his Priest and King, Who make up a heaven of our misery.\"@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry \" 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!\" So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep. There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said, \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\" And so he was quiet, & that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight! That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, Were all of them locked up in coffins of black; And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he opened the coffins & set them all free; Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run, And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father & never want joy. And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark And got with our bags & our brushes to work. Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm; So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Old John, with white hair Does laugh away care, Sitting under the oak, Among the old folk, They laugh at our play, And soon they all say. ‘Such, such were the joys. When we all girls & boys, In our youth-time were seen, On the Ecchoing Green.’ Till the little ones weary No more can be merry The sun does descend, And our sports have an end: Round the laps of their mothers, Many sisters and brothers, Like birds in their nest, Are ready for rest; And sport no more seen, On the darkening Green.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not. writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love, That so many sweet flowers bore. And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be: And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys & desires.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Is this a holy thing to see, In a rich and fruitful land, Babes reducd to misery, Fed with cold and usurous hand? Is that trembling cry a song? Can it be a song of joy? And so many children poor? It is a land of poverty! And their sun does never shine. And their fields are bleak & bare. And their ways are fill'd with thorns. It is eternal winter there. For where-e'er the sun does shine, And where-e'er the rain does fall: Babe can never hunger there, Nor poverty the mind appall.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean The children walking two & two in red & blue & green Grey-headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow, Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow O what a multitude they seemd these flowers of London town Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs Thousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of Heaven among Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I heard an Angel singing When the day was springing Mercy Pity Peace Is the worlds release Thus he sung all day Over the new mown hay Till the sun went down And haycocks looked brown I heard a Devil curse Over the heath & the furze Mercy could be no more If there was nobody poor And pity no more could be If all were as happy as we At his curse the sun went down And the heavens gave a frown Down pourd the heavy rain Over the new reapd grain And Miseries increase Is Mercy Pity Peace@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I saw a chapel all of gold That none did dare to enter in And many weeping stood without Weeping mourning worshippingI saw a serpent rise between The white pillars of the door And he forcd & forcd & forcd Down the golden hinges tore And along the pavement sweet Set with pearls and rubies bright All his slimy length he drew Till upon the altar white Vomiting his poison out On the bread & on the wineSo I turnd into a sty And laid me down among the swine@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My mother groand! my father wept. Into the dangerous world I leapt: Helpless, naked, piping loud; Like a fiend hid in a cloud. Struggling in my fathers hands: Striving against my swaddling bands: Bound and weary I thought best To sulk upon my mothers breast.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Hear the voice of the Bard! Who Present, Past, & Future sees Whose ears have heard, The Holy Word, That walk'd among the ancient trees. Calling the lapsed Soul And weeping in the evening dew: That might controll, The starry pole; And fallen fallen light renew! O Earth O Earth return! Arise from out the dewy grass; Night is worn, And the morn Rises from the slumberous mass. Turn away no more: Why wilt thou turn away The starry floor The watry shore Is giv'n thee till the break of day.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Piping down the valleys wild Piping songs of pleasant glee On a cloud I saw a child. And he laughing said to me. Pipe a song about a Lamb; So I piped with merry chear, Piper pipe that song again— So I piped, he wept to hear. Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe Sing thy songs of happy chear, So I sung the same again While he wept with joy to hear Piper sit thee down and write In a book that all may read— So he vanish'd from my sight. And I pluck'd a hollow reed. And I made a rural pen, And I stain'd the water clear, And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon Englands mountains green: And was the holy Lamb of God, On Englands pleasant pastures seen!

Bring me my Bow of burning gold: Bring me my arrows of desire: Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold! Bring me my Chariot of fire! I will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand: Till we have built Jerusalem, In Englands green & pleasant Land.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child: But I am black as if bereav'd of light. My mother taught me underneath a tree And sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissed me, And pointing to the east began to say. Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive Comfort in morning joy in the noonday. And we are put on earth a little space, That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove. For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love & care, And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice. Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him and he will then love me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold, But the Ale-house is healthy & pleasant & warm; Besides I can tell where I am use'd well, Such usage in heaven will never do well. But if at the Church they would give us some Ale. And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale; We'd sing and we'd pray, all the live-long day; Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray, Then the Parson might preach & drink & sing. And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring: And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church, Would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch. And God like a father rejoicing to see, His children as pleasant and happy as he: Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel But kiss him & give him both drink and apparel.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow. And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every Man, In every Infants cry of fear, In every voice: in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear How the Chimney-sweepers cry Every blackning Church appalls, And the hapless Soldiers sigh Runs in blood down Palace walls But most thro' midnight streets I hear How the youthful Harlots curse Blasts the new-born Infants tear And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The wild winds weep, And the night is a-cold; Come hither, Sleep, And my griefs infold: But lo! the morning peeps Over the eastern steeps, And the rustling birds of dawn The earth do scorn. Lo! to the vault Of paved heaven, With sorrow fraught My notes are driven: They strike the ear of night, Make weep the eyes of day; They make mad the roaring winds, And with tempests play. Like a fiend in a cloud With howling woe, After night I do croud, And with night will go; I turn my back to the east, From whence comforts have increas'd; For light doth seize my brain With frantic pain.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep. Once meek, and in a perilous path, The just man kept his course along The vale of death. Roses are planted where thorns grow, And on the barren heath Sing the honey bees. Then the perilous path was planted: And a river and a spring On every cliff and tomb; And on the bleached bones Red clay brought forth. Till the villain left the paths of ease, To walk in perilous paths, and drive The just man into barren climes. Now the sneaking serpent walks In mild humility, And the just man rages in the wilds Where lions roam. Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I was angry with my friend; I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I waterd it in fears, Night & morning with my tears: And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night. Till it bore an apple bright. And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine. And into my garden stole, When the night had veild the pole; In the morning glad I see; My foe outstretched beneath the tree.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How sweet I roam'd from field to field, And tasted all the summer's pride, 'Till I the prince of love beheld, Who in the sunny beams did glide! He shew'd me lilies for my hair, And blushing roses for my brow; He led me through his gardens fair, Where all his golden pleasures grow. With sweet May dews my wings were wet, And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage; He caught me in his silken net, And shut me in his golden cage. He loves to sit and hear me sing, Then, laughing, sports and plays with me; Then stretches out my golden wing, And mocks my loss of liberty.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Memory, hither come, And tune your merry notes; And, while upon the wind, Your music floats, I'll pore upon the stream, Where sighing lovers dream, And fish for fancies as they pass Within the watery glass. I'll drink of the clear stream, And hear the linnet's song; And there I'll lie and dream The day along: And, when night comes, I'll go To places fit for woe, Walking along the darken'd valley, With silent Melancholy.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My silks and fine array, My smiles and languish'd air, By love are driv'n away; And mournful lean Despair Brings me yew to deck my grave: Such end true lovers have. His face is fair as heav'n, When springing buds unfold; O why to him was't giv'n, Whose heart is wintry cold? His breast is love's all worship'd tomb, Where all love's pilgrims come. Bring me an axe and spade, Bring me a winding sheet; When I my grave have made, Let winds and tempests beat: Then down I'll lie, as cold as clay. True love doth pass away!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How have you left the ancient love That bards of old enjoy'd in you! The languid strings do scarcely move! The sound is forc'd, the notes are few!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain, In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp, Dare its deadly terrors clasp! When the stars threw down their spears And water'd heaven with their tears: Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I burned my life, that I might find A passion wholly of the mind, Thought divorced from eye and bone, Ecstasy come to breath alone. I broke my life, to seek relief From the flawed light of love and grief. With mounting beat the utter fire Charred existence and desire. It died low, ceased its sudden thresh. I had found unmysterious flesh— Not the mind’s avid substance—still Passionate beyond the will.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You have put your two hands upon me, and your mouth, You have said my name as a prayer. Here where trees are planted by the water I have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret, And your lips, closed over all that love cannot say, My mother remembers the agony of her womb And long years that seemed to promise more than this. She says, “You do not love me, You do not want me, You will go away.” In the country whereto I go I shall not see the face of my friend Nor her hair the color of sunburnt grasses; Together we shall not find The land on whose hills bends the new moon In air traversed of birds. What have I thought of love? I have said, “It is beauty and sorrow.” I have thought that it would bring me lost delights, and splendor As a wind out of old time. . . But there is only the evening here, And the sound of willows Now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
To me, one silly task is like another. I bare the shambling tricks of lust and pride. This flesh will never give a child its mother,— Song, like a wing, tears through my breast, my side, And madness chooses out my voice again, Again. I am the chosen no hand saves: The shrieking heaven lifted over men, Not the dumb earth, wherein they set their graves.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
She has attained the permanence She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning. Untended stalks blow over her Even and swift, like young men running. Always in the heart she loved Others had lived,—she heard their laughter. She lies where none has lain before, Where certainly none will follow after.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I You may have all things from me, save my breath, The slight life in my throat will not give pause For your love, nor your loss, nor any cause. Shall I be made a panderer to death, Dig the green ground for darkness underneath, Let the dust serve me, covering all that was With all that will be? Better, from time’s claws, The hardened face under the subtle wreath. Cooler than stones in wells, sweeter, more kind Than hot, perfidious words, my breathing moves Close to my plunging blood. Be strong, and hang Unriven mist over my breast and mind, My breath! We shall forget the heart that loves, Though in my body beat its blade, and its fang. II I erred, when I thought loneliness the wide Scent of mown grass over forsaken fields, Or any shadow isolation yields. Loneliness was the heart within your side. Your thought, beyond my touch, was tilted air Ringed with as many borders as the wind. How could I judge you gentle or unkind When all bright flying space was in your care? Now that I leave you, I shall be made lonely By simple empty days, never that chill Resonant heart to strike between my arms Again, as though distraught for distance,­–only Levels of evening, now, behind a hill, Or a late cock-crow from the darkening farms.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When beauty breaks and falls asunder I feel no grief for it, but wonder. When love, like a frail shell, lies broken, I keep no chip of it for token. I never had a man for friend Who did not know that love must end. I never had a girl for lover Who could discern when love was over. What the wise doubt, the fool believes— Who is it, then, that love deceives?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I do not know where either of us can turn Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. I do not know how we can bear The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. We shall wish not to be alone And that love were not dispersed and set free— Though you defeat me, And I be heavy upon you. But like earth heaped over the heart Is love grown perfect. Like a shell over the beat of life Is love perfect to the last. So let it be the same Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; Let us know this for leavetaking, That I may not be heavy upon you, That you may blind me no more.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I came here, being stricken, stumbling out At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me For days, the time being the last of autumn, The thickets not yet stark, but quivering With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in The manner of the pointillists; small yellows Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern, Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes, A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth. I had these, and my food and sleep—enough. This is a countryside of roofless houses,— Taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs. Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky. Here I could well devise the journey to nothing, At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns, The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits, Showering motionless stars over the houses. Scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut. But why the journey to nothing or any desire? Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure, The goal a coffer of dust? Give my mouth to the air, Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue Rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings, The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin Under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,— The cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms, Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . . Forever enough to part grass over the stones By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks; To hear in the single wind diverse branches Repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel, Fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence, To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig Broken away from whatever growth could snare it Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer Or beat it under in snow. I must get well. Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense, Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic, Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks, Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair. I must feel again who had given feeling over, Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano, Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster. To escape is nothing. Not to escape is nothing. The farmer’s wife stands with a halo of darkness Rounding her head. Water drips in the kitchen Tapping the sink. To-day the maples have split Limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound. The vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking Roofs I have told you of.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I had come to the house, in a cave of trees, Facing a sheer sky. Everything moved,—a bell hung ready to strike, Sun and reflection wheeled by. When the bare eyes were before me And the hissing hair, Held up at a window, seen through a door. The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead Formed in the air. This is a dead scene forever now. Nothing will ever stir. The end will never brighten it more than this, Nor the rain blur. The water will always fall, and will not fall, And the tipped bell make no sound. The grass will always be growing for hay Deep on the ground. And I shall stand here like a shadow Under the great balanced day, My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind, And does not drift away.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My voice, not being proud Like a strong woman’s, that cries Imperiously aloud That death disarm her, lull her— Screams for no mourning color Laid menacingly, like fire, Over my long desire. It will end, and leave no print. As you lie, I shall lie: Separate, eased, and cured. Whatever is wasted or wanted In this country of glass and flint Some garden will use, once planted. As you lie alone, I shall lie, O, in singleness assured, Deafened by mire and lime. I remember, while there is time.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
She has no need to fear the fall Of harvest from the laddered reach Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing From the steep beach. Nor hold to pain's effrontery Her body's bulwark, stern and savage, Nor be a glass, where to forsee Another's ravage. What she has gathered, and what lost, She will not find to lose again. She is possessed by time, who once Was loved by men.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Love me because I am lost; Love me that I am undone. That is brave,—no man has wished it, Not one. Be strong, to look on my heart As others look on my face. Love me,—I tell you that it is a ravaged Terrible place.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Now that I have your face by heart, I look Less at its features than its darkening frame Where quince and melon, yellow as young flame, Lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd’s crook. Beyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease The lead and marble figures watch the show Of yet another summer loath to go Although the scythes hang in the apple trees. Now that I have your face by heart, I look. Now that I have your voice by heart, I read In the black chords upon a dulling page Music that is not meant for music’s cage, Whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed. The staves are shuttled over with a stark Unprinted silence. In a double dream I must spell out the storm, the running stream. The beat’s too swift. The notes shift in the dark. Now that I have your voice by heart, I read. Now that I have your heart by heart, I see The wharves with their great ships and architraves; The rigging and the cargo and the slaves On a strange beach under a broken sky. O not departure, but a voyage done! The bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps Its red rust downward, and the long vine creeps Beside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun. Now that I have your heart by heart, I see.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Since you would claim the sources of my thoughtRecall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed,The reedy traps which other hands have timedTo close upon it. Conjure up the hotBlaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snowDevised to strike it down. It will be free.Whatever nets draw in to prison meAt length your eyes must turn to watch it go. My mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well,My body hear no echo save its own,Yet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud,Seek out the storm, escape the bitter spellThat we obey, strain to the wind, be thrownStraight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here, in the withered arbor, like the arrested wind, Straight sides, carven knees, Stands the statue, with hands flung out in alarm Or remonstrances. Over the lintel sway the woven bracts of the vine In a pattern of angles. The quill of the fountain falters, woods rake on the sky Their brusque tangles. The birds walk by slowly, circling the marble girl, The golden quails, The pheasants, closed up in their arrowy wings, Dragging their sharp tails. The inquietudes of the sap and of the blood are spent. What is forsaken will rest. But her heel is lifted,—she would flee,—the whistle of the birds Fails on her breast.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This youth too long has heard the break Of waters in a land of change. He goes to see what suns can make From soil more indurateindurate hardened and strange. He cuts what holds his days together And shuts him in, as lock on lock: The arrowed vane announcing weather, The tripping rackettripping racket either a paradox: light and easy din, or, light and easy motion (as of a dance) of a clock; Seeking, I think, a light that waits Still as a lamp upon a shelf, — A land with hills like rocky gates Where no sea leaps upon itself. But he will find that nothing dares To be enduring, save where, south Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares On beauty with a rusted mouth, — Where something dreadful and another Look quietly upon each other.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The dark is thrown Back from the brightness, like hair Cast over a shoulder. I am alone, Four years older; Like the chairs and the walls Which I once watched brighten With you beside me. I was to waken Never like this, whatever came or was taken. The stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. Apples come, and the month for their fall. The bark spreads, the roots tighten. Though today be the last Or tomorrow all, You will not mind. That I may not remember Does not matter. I shall not be with you again. What we knew, even now Must scatter And be ruined, and blow Like dust in the rain. You have been dead a long season And have less than desire Who were lover with lover; And I have life—that old reason To wait for what comes, To leave what is over.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Women have no wilderness in them, They are provident instead, Content in the tight hot cell of their hearts To eat dusty bread. They do not see cattle cropping red winter grass, They do not hear Snow water going down under culverts Shallow and clear. They wait, when they should turn to journeys, They stiffen, when they should bend. They use against themselves that benevolence To which no man is friend. They cannot think of so many crops to a field Or of clean wood cleft by an axe. Their love is an eager meaninglessness Too tense, or too lax. They hear in every whisper that speaks to them A shout and a cry. As like as not, when they take life over their door-sills They should let it go by.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Nothing was remembered, nothing forgotten. When we awoke, wagons were passing on the warm summer pavements, The window-sills were wet from rain in the night, Birds scattered and settled over chimneypots As among grotesque trees. Nothing was accepted, nothing looked beyond. Slight-voiced bells separated hour from hour, The afternoon sifted coolness And people drew together in streets becoming deserted. There was a moon, and light in a shop-front, And dusk falling like precipitous water. Hand clasped hand Forehead still bowed to forehead— Nothing was lost, nothing possessed There was no gift nor denial. 2. I have remembered you. You were not the town visited once, Nor the road falling behind running feet. You were as awkward as flesh And lighter than frost or ashes. You were the rind, And the white-juiced apple, The song, and the words waiting for music. 3. You have learned the beginning; Go from mine to the other. Be together; eat, dance, despair, Sleep, be threatened, endure. You will know the way of that. But at the end, be insolent; Be absurd—strike the thing short off; Be mad—only do not let talk Wear the bloom from silence. And go away without fire or lantern Let there be some uncertainty about your departure.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Fresh out of the icebox, this brain looks the wrong way from time to time, and misses the cat stepping by, Gerry on the screen laboring to tell the nuances his pink matter almost notices, he’s not my brother, not really my close friend, just my necessary neighbor on a bicycle going by like a whistle from the lips of someone I trust. He has a peculiar skeleton arranged his own way in the mind’s pasture. We were as they say “of an age” and so inter- twine somehow, though I wanted to work when he wanted to play. That long nose is in my life and in my writing and so is the Okanagan River. I sometimes get to the river when I am at work, the sun on my back not the ink in my pen. There was, when I was last in the Okanagan Valley, a cat with big paws in the neighborhood, I was told, fires I could see along the hillside, stunning heat from the sky, enough to thaw any brain.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Being in a coma can play havoc with your sense of time. It can turn your eyes from brown to blue. It can grow hair on your belly, it can get you lost between bedroom and office. If you are to live in extra innings, you’ll have to watch the corners, step around bad things, ignore insults and welcome loving hands that sculpt you in your chair. Being refrigerated and put to sleep, dropping out of time, you have to save your humor and guard it, a precious trove to bring out as needed, white strips on the road flying beneath your vehicle, eat them up, wake to a busy underground world, where people in body bags keep passing by, tilted toward you know where. Where half the people in your life have gone, dissolving your sense of time, which was never supposed to have an end.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Imagine that — my last words might have been spoken to the dog, she who saved my life, it has been said, spoken with no thought of reply nor of understanding, a genial insult maybe, a philosophical conundrum posed aeons before any household pet ever turned an ear. In the ambulance I made no remark about trees nor how tired I was of them, and in the second ambulance our dog’s heart beat hard with terror.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

There are at least two types of people, the first for whom the ordinary worldliness is easy. The regular social routines and material cares are nothing too external to them and easily absorbed. They are not alien from the creation and maintenance of the world, and the world does not treat them as alien. And also, from them, the efforts toward the world, and to them, the fulfillment of the world's moderate desires, flow. They are ef- fortless at eating, moving, arranging their arms as they sit or stand, being hired, being paid, cleaning up, spending, playing, mating. They are in an ease and comfort. The world is for the world and for them. Then there are those over whom the events and opportunities of the every- day world wash over. There is rarely, in this second type, any easy kind of absorption. There is only a visible evidence of having been made of a different substance, one that repels. Also, from them, it is almost impos- sible to give to the world what it will welcome or reward. For how does this second type hold their arms? Across their chest? Behind their back? And how do they find food to eat and then prepare this food? And how do they receive a check or endorse it? And what also of the difficulties of love or being loved, its expansiveness, the way it is used for markets and indentured moods? And what is this second substance? And how does it come to have as one of its qualities the resistance of the world as it is? And also, what is the person made of the second substance? Is this a human or more or less than one? Where is the true impermeable community of the second human whose arms do not easily arrange themselves and for whom the salaries and weddings and garages do not come? These are, perhaps, not two sorts of persons, but two kinds of fortune. The first is soft and regular. The second is a baffled kind, and magnetic only to the second substance, and made itself out of a different, second, substance, and having, at its end, a second, and almost blank-faced, reward.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A clamor, in the distance. A crowd running under the rain beatingdown, between the canvases the sea wind set clattering.A man passes crying something. What is he saying? What heknows!

He dreamed, all the same; but on that day, He gave a better use to beauty's shapes: He understood that form means to die. And this, his final work, is a coin With both sides bare.

This is what our dying looks like. You believe in the sun. I believe I can't love you. Always be closing, Said our favorite professor before He let the gun go off in his mouth.

In those days, though, I never analysed Myself even. All analysis comes late. You catch a sight of Nature, earliest, In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink And drop before the wonder of ‘t; you miss The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days, And wrote because I lived–unlicensed else: My heart beat in my brain. Life’s violent flood Abolished bounds,–and, which my neighbour’s field, Which mine, what mattered? It is so in youth. We play at leap-frog over the god Term; The love within us and the love without Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love, We scarce distinguish. So, with other power. Being acted on and acting seem the same: In that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels, We know not if the forests move or we. And so, like most young poets, in a flush Of individual life, I poured myself Along the veins of others, and achieved Mere lifeless imitations of life verse, And made the living answer for the dead, Profaning nature. ‘Touch not, do not taste, Nor handle,’–we’re too legal, who write young: We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs, As if still ignorant of counterpoint; We call the Muse ... ‘O Muse, benignant Muse!’– As if we had seen her purple-braided head. With the eyes in it start between the boughs As often as a stag’s. What make-believe, With so much earnest! what effete results, From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes From such white heats!–bucolics, where the cows Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud In lashing off the flies,–didactics, driven Against the heels of what the master said; And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps A babe might blow between two straining cheeks Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh; And elegiac griefs, and songs of love, Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road, The worse for being warm: all these things, writ On happy mornings, with a morning heart, That leaps for love, is active for resolve, Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood. The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped, Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in. Spare the old bottles!–spill not the new wine. By Keats’s soul, the man who never stepped In gradual progress like another man, But, turning grandly on his central self, Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years And died, not young,–(the life of a long life, Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear Upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn For ever;) by that strong excepted soul, I count it strange, and hard to understand, That nearly all young poets should write old; That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen, And beardless Byron academical, And so with others. It may be, perhaps, Such have not settled long and deep enough In trance, to attain to clairvoyance,–and still The memory mixes with the vision, spoils, And works it turbid. Or perhaps, again, In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx, The melancholy desert must sweep round, Behind you, as before.– For me, I wrote False poems, like the rest, and thought them true. Because myself was true in writing them. I, peradventure, have writ true ones since With less complacence. But I could not hide My quickening inner life from those at watch. They saw a light at a window now and then, They had not set there. Who had set it there? My father’s sister started when she caught My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say I had no business with a sort of soul, But plainly she objected,–and demurred, That souls were dangerous things to carry straight Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world. She said sometimes, ‘Aurora, have you done Your task this morning?–have you read that book? And are you ready for the crochet here?’– As if she said, ‘I know there’s something wrong, I know I have not ground you down enough To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust For household uses and proprieties, Before the rain has got into my barn And set the grains a-sprouting. What, you’re green With out-door impudence? you almost grow?’ To which I answered, ‘@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
'There it is!– You play beside a death-bed like a child, Yet measure to yourself a prophet's place To teach the living. None of all these things, Can women understand. You generalise, Oh, nothing!–not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts, So sympathetic to the personal pang, Close on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up A whole life at each wound; incapable Of deepening, widening a large lap of life To hold the world-full woe. The human race To you means, such a child, or such a man, You saw one morning waiting in the cold, Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather up A few such cases, and, when strong, sometimes Will write of factories and of slaves, as if Your father were a negro, and your son A spinner in the mills. All's yours and you,– All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard To general suffering. Here's the world half blind With intellectual light, half brutalised With civilization, having caught the plague In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain And sin too! ... does one woman of you all, (You who weep easily) grow pale to see This tiger shake his cage?–does one of you Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls And pine and die, because of the great sum Of universal anguish?–Show me a tear Wet as Cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours, Because the world is mad? You cannot count, That you should weep for this account, not you! You weep for what you know. A red-haired child Sick in a fever, if you touch him once, Though but so little as with a finger-tip, Will set you weeping! but a million sick . . You could as soon weep for the rule of three, Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world Uncomprehended by you must remain Uninfluenced by you. Women as you are, Mere women, personal and passionate, You give us doating mothers, and chaste wives. Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints! We get no Christ from you,–and verily We shall not get a poet, in my mind.' 'With which conclusion you conclude' . . 'But this– That you, Aurora, with the large live brow And steady eyelids, cannot condescend To play at art, as children play at swords, To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired Because true action is impossible. You never can be satisfied with praise Which men give women when they judge a book Not as mere work, but as mere woman's work, Expressing the comparative respect Which means the absolute scorn. 'Oh, excellent! 'What grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps! 'What delicate discernment ... almost thought! 'The book does honour to the sex, we hold. 'Among our female authors we make room 'For this fair writer, and congratulate 'The country that produces in these times 'Such women, competent to ... spell.'' 'Stop there!' I answered–burning through his thread of talk With a quick flame of emotion,–'You have read My soul, if not my book, and argue well I would not condescend ... we will not say To such a kind of praise, (a worthless end Is praise of all kinds) but to such a use Of holy art and golden life. I am young, And peradventure weak–you tell me so– Through being a woman. And, for all the rest, Take thanks for justice. I would rather dance At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped Their gingerbread for joy,–than shift the types For tolerable verse, intolerable To men who act and suffer. Better far, Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means, Than a sublime art frivolously.' * Then I spoke. 'I have not stood long on the strand of life, And these salt waters have had scarcely time To creep so high up as to wet my feet. I cannot judge these tides–I shall, perhaps. A woman's always younger than a man At equal years, because she is disallowed Maturing by the outdoor sun and air, And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk. Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise! You think a woman ripens as a peach,– In the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now; I'm young in age, and younger still, I think, As a woman.

Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers, Ere the sorrow comes with years ? They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, — And that cannot stop their tears. The young lambs are bleating in the meadows ; The young birds are chirping in the nest ; The young fawns are playing with the shadows ; The young flowers are blowing toward the west— But the young, young children, O my brothers, They are weeping bitterly ! They are weeping in the playtime of the others, In the country of the free. Do you question the young children in the sorrow, Why their tears are falling so ? The old man may weep for his to-morrow Which is lost in Long Ago — The old tree is leafless in the forest — The old year is ending in the frost — The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest — The old hope is hardest to be lost : But the young, young children, O my brothers, Do you ask them why they stand Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers, In our happy Fatherland ? They look up with their pale and sunken faces, And their looks are sad to see, For the man's grief abhorrent, draws and presses Down the cheeks of infancy — \"Your old earth,\" they say, \"is very dreary;\" \"Our young feet,\" they say, \"are very weak !\" Few paces have we taken, yet are weary— Our grave-rest is very far to seek ! Ask the old why they weep, and not the children, For the outside earth is cold — And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering, And the graves are for the old !\" \"True,\" say the children, \"it may happen That we die before our time ! Little Alice died last year her grave is shapen Like a snowball, in the rime. We looked into the pit prepared to take her — Was no room for any work in the close clay : From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her, Crying, 'Get up, little Alice ! it is day.' If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower, With your ear down, little Alice never cries ; Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her, For the smile has time for growing in her eyes ,— And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in The shroud, by the kirk-chime ! It is good when it happens,\" say the children, \"That we die before our time !\" Alas, the wretched children ! they are seeking Death in life, as best to have ! They are binding up their hearts away from breaking, With a cerement from the grave. Go out, children, from the mine and from the city — Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do — Pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through ! But they answer, \" Are your cowslips of the meadows Like our weeds anear the mine ? Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows, From your pleasures fair and fine! \"For oh,\" say the children, \"we are weary, And we cannot run or leap — If we cared for any meadows, it were merely To drop down in them and sleep. Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping — We fall upon our faces, trying to go ; And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping, The reddest flower would look as pale as snow. For, all day, we drag our burden tiring, Through the coal-dark, underground — Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron In the factories, round and round. \"For all day, the wheels are droning, turning, — Their wind comes in our faces, — Till our hearts turn, — our heads, with pulses burning, And the walls turn in their places Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling — Turns the long light that droppeth down the wall, — Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling — All are turning, all the day, and we with all ! — And all day, the iron wheels are droning ; And sometimes we could pray, 'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning) 'Stop ! be silent for to-day ! ' \" Ay ! be silent ! Let them hear each other breathing For a moment, mouth to mouth — Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing Of their tender human youth ! Let them feel that this cold metallic motion Is not all the life God fashions or reveals — Let them prove their inward souls against the notion That they live in you, or unde@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; That only men incredulous of despair, Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness, In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express Grief for thy dead in silence like to death— Most like a monumental statue set In everlasting watch and moveless woe Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: If it could weep, it could arise and go.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
\" Yes !\" I answered you last night ; \" No !\" this morning, Sir, I say ! Colours, seen by candle-light, Will not look the same by day. When the tabors played their best, Lamps above, and laughs below — Love me sounded like a jest, Fit for Yes or fit for No ! Call me false, or call me free — Vow, whatever light may shine, No man on your face shall see Any grief for change on mine. Yet the sin is on us both — Time to dance is not to woo — Wooer light makes fickle troth — Scorn of me recoils on you ! Learn to win a lady's faith Nobly, as the thing is high ; Bravely, as for life and death — With a loyal gravity. Lead her from the festive boards, Point her to the starry skies, Guard her, by your truthful words, Pure from courtship's flatteries. By your truth she shall be true — Ever true, as wives of yore — And her Yes, once said to you, SHALL be Yes for evermore.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We cannot live, except thus mutually We alternate, aware or unaware, The reflex act of life: and when we bear Our virtue onward most impulsively, Most full of invocation, and to be Most instantly compellant, certes, there We live most life, whoever breathes most air And counts his dying years by sun and sea. But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth Throw out her full force on another soul, The conscience and the concentration both Make mere life, Love.

X Through all hopes that keep us brave, Farther off or nigher, Love me for the house and grave, And for something higher. XI Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear, Woman’s love no fable. I will love thee—half a year— As a man is able.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east, And one of them shot in the west by the sea. Dead ! both my boys ! When you sit at the feast And are wanting a great song for Italy free, Let none look at me ! II. Yet I was a poetess only last year, And good at my art, for a woman, men said ; But this woman, this, who is agonized here, — The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head For ever instead. III. What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain ! What art is she good at, but hurting her breast With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain ? Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you pressed, And I proud, by that test. IV. What art's for a woman ? To hold on her knees Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her throat, Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by degrees And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat ; To dream and to doat. V. To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them indeed Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt, That a country's a thing men should die for at need. I prated of liberty, rights, and about The tyrant cast out. VI. And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! ... I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the wheels Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels ! God, how the house feels ! VII. At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled With my kisses, — of camp-life and glory, and how They both loved me ; and, soon coming home to be spoiled In return would fan off every fly from my brow With their green laurel-bough. VIII. Then was triumph at Turin : Ancona was free !' And some one came out of the cheers in the street, With a face pale as stone, to say something to me. My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his feet, While they cheered in the street. IX. I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked sublime As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained To the height he had gained. X. And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong, Writ now but in one hand, I was not to faint, — One loved me for two — would be with me ere long : And Viva l' Italia ! — he died for, our saint, Who forbids our complaint.\" XI. My Nanni would add, he was safe, and aware Of a presence that turned off the balls, — was imprest It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear, And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed, To live on for the rest.\" XII. On which, without pause, up the telegraph line Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : — Shot. Tell his mother. Ah, ah, his, ' their ' mother, — not mine, ' No voice says \"My mother\" again to me. What ! You think Guido forgot ? XIII. Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven, They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe ? I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled so The Above and Below. XIV. O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I pray, How we common mothers stand desolate, mark, Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away, And no last word to say ! XV. Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We all Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one. 'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall ; And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it done If we have not a son ? XVI. Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's taken, what then ? When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men ? When the guns of Cavalli with final retort Have cut the game short ? XVII. When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee, When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red, When you have your country from mountain to sea, When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head, (And I have my Dead) — XVIII. What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low, And burn your lights faintly ! My country is there, Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow : My Italy '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan, Down in the reeds by the river ? Spreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat With the dragon-fly on the river. II. He tore out a reed, the great god Pan, From the deep cool bed of the river : The limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away, Ere he brought it out of the river. III. High on the shore sate the great god Pan, While turbidly flowed the river ; And hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed To prove it fresh from the river. IV. He cut it short, did the great god Pan, (How tall it stood in the river !) Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing In holes, as he sate by the river. V. This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan, Laughed while he sate by the river,) The only way, since gods began To make sweet music, they could succeed.' Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed, He blew in power by the river. VI. Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan ! Piercing sweet by the river ! Blinding sweet, O great god Pan ! The sun on the hill forgot to die, And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly Came back to dream on the river. VII. Yet half a beast is the great god Pan, To laugh as he sits by the river, Making a poet out of a man : The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, — For the reed which grows nevermore again As a reed with the reeds in the river.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. ENOUGH ! we're tired, my heart and I. We sit beside the headstone thus, And wish that name were carved for us. The moss reprints more tenderly The hard types of the mason's knife, As heaven's sweet life renews earth's life With which we're tired, my heart and I. II. You see we're tired, my heart and I. We dealt with books, we trusted men, And in our own blood drenched the pen, As if such colours could not fly. We walked too straight for fortune's end, We loved too true to keep a friend ; At last we're tired, my heart and I. III. How tired we feel, my heart and I ! We seem of no use in the world ; Our fancies hang grey and uncurled About men's eyes indifferently ; Our voice which thrilled you so, will let You sleep; our tears are only wet : What do we here, my heart and I ? IV. So tired, so tired, my heart and I ! It was not thus in that old time When Ralph sat with me 'neath the lime To watch the sunset from the sky. Dear love, you're looking tired,' he said; I, smiling at him, shook my head : 'Tis now we're tired, my heart and I. V. So tired, so tired, my heart and I ! Though now none takes me on his arm To fold me close and kiss me warm Till each quick breath end in a sigh Of happy languor. Now, alone, We lean upon this graveyard stone, Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I. VI. Tired out we are, my heart and I. Suppose the world brought diadems To tempt us, crusted with loose gems Of powers and pleasures ? Let it try. We scarcely care to look at even A pretty child, or God's blue heaven, We feel so tired, my heart and I. VII. Yet who complains ? My heart and I ? In this abundant earth no doubt Is little room for things worn out : Disdain them, break them, throw them by And if before the days grew rough We once were loved, used, — well enough, I think, we've fared, my heart and I.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. FRIENDS of faces unknown and a land Unvisited over the sea, Who tell me how lonely you stand With a single gold curl in the hand Held up to be looked at by me, — II. While you ask me to ponder and say What a father and mother can do, With the bright fellow-locks put away Out of reach, beyond kiss, in the clay Where the violets press nearer than you. III. Shall I speak like a poet, or run Into weak woman's tears for relief ? Oh, children ! — I never lost one, — Yet my arm 's round my own little son, And Love knows the secret of Grief. IV. And I feel what it must be and is, When God draws a new angel so Through the house of a man up to His, With a murmur of music, you miss, And a rapture of light, you forgo. V. How you think, staring on at the door, Where the face of your angel flashed in, That its brightness, familiar before, Burns off from you ever the more For the dark of your sorrow and sin. VI. God lent him and takes him,' you sigh ; — Nay, there let me break with your pain : God 's generous in giving, say I, — And the thing which He gives, I deny That He ever can take back again. VII. He gives what He gives. I appeal To all who bear babes — in the hour When the veil of the body we feel Rent round us, — while torments reveal The motherhood's advent in power, VIII. And the babe cries ! — has each of us known By apocalypse (God being there Full in nature) the child is our own, Life of life, love of love, moan of moan, Through all changes, all times, everywhere. IX. He 's ours and for ever. Believe, O father ! — O mother, look back To the first love's assurance. To give Means with God not to tempt or deceive With a cup thrust in Benjamin's sack. X. He gives what He gives. Be content ! He resumes nothing given, — be sure ! God lend ? Where the usurers lent In His temple, indignant He went And scourged away all those impure. XI. He lends not ; but gives to the end, As He loves to the end. If it seem That He draws back a gift, comprehend 'Tis to add to it rather, — amend, And finish it up to your dream, — XII. Or keep, — as a mother will toys Too costly, though given by herself, Till the room shall be stiller from noise, And the children more fit for such joys, Kept over their heads on the shelf. XIII. So look up, friends ! you, who indeed Have possessed in your house a sweet piece Of the Heaven which men strive for, must need Be more earnest than others are,—speed Where they loiter, persist where they cease. XIV. You know how one angel smiles there. Then weep not. 'Tis easy for you To be drawn by a single gold hair Of that curl, from earth's storm and despair, To the safe place above us. Adieu.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
MY future will not copy fair my pastOn any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done,Supernal Will ! I would not fain be oneWho, satisfying thirst and breaking fastUpon the fulness of the heart, at lastSaith no grace after meat. My wine hath runIndeed out of my cup, and there is noneTo gather up the bread of my repastScattered and trampled ! Yet I find some goodIn earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble upClear from the darkling ground, — content untilI sit with angels before better food.Dear Christ ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I thought once how Theocritus had sung Of the sweet years, the dear and wished for years, Who each one in a gracious hand appears To bear a gift for mortals, old or young: And, as I mused it in his antique tongue, I saw, in gradual vision through my tears, The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years, Those of my own life, who by turns had flung A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware, So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair, And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, ... Guess now who holds thee?'—Death,' I said. But there, The silver answer rang ... Not Death, but Love.'@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If thou must love me, let it be for nought Except for love's sake only. Do not say I love her for her smile ... her look ... her way Of speaking gently, ... for a trick of thought That falls in well with mine, and certes brought A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'— For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought, May be unwrought so. Neither love me for Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,— A creature might forget to weep, who bore Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby! But love me for love's sake, that evermore Thou may'st love on, through love's eternity.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Beloved, my Beloved, when I think That thou wast in the world a year ago, What time I sate alone here in the snow And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink No moment at thy voice ... but, link by link, Went counting all my chains, as if that so They never could fall off at any blow Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I drink Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful, Never to feel thee thrill the day or night With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull, Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When our two souls stand up erect and strong, Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher, Until the lengthening wings break into fire At either curvéd point, — what bitter wrong Can the earth do to us, that we should not long Be here contented ? Think. In mounting higher, The angels would press on us, and aspire To drop some golden orb of perfect song Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay Rather on earth, Belovèd, — where the unfit Contrarious moods of men recoil away And isolate pure spirits, and permit A place to stand and love in for a day, With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I lived with visions for my company, Instead of men and women, years ago, And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me. But soon their trailing purple was not free Of this world's dust, — their lutes did silent grow, And I myself grew faint and blind below Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come ... to be, Belovèd, what they seemed. Their shining fronts, Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same, As river-water hallowed into fonts) Met in thee, and from out thee overcame My soul with satisfaction of all wants — Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My letters! all dead paper, ... mute and white ! — And yet they seem alive and quivering Against my tremulous hands which loose the string And let them drop down on my knee to-night. This said, ... he wished to have me in his sight Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring To come and touch my hand ... a simple thing, Yet I wept for it! — this, ... the paper's light ... Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed As if God's future thundered on my past. This said, I am thine — and so its ink has paled With lying at my heart that beat too fast. And this ... O Love, thy words have ill availed, If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange And be all to me? Shall I never miss Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, When I look up, to drop on a new range Of walls and floors ... another home than this? Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change? That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried, To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove; For grief indeed is love and grief beside. Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love. Yet love me—wilt thou? Open thine heart wide, And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
First time he kissed me, he but only kissed The fingers of this hand wherewith I write, And ever since it grew more clean and white,... Slow to world-greetings...quick with its “Oh, list,” When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst I could not wear here plainer to my sight, Than that first kiss. The second passed in height The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed! That was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown, With sanctifying sweetness, did precede. The third, upon my lips, was folded down In perfect, purple state! since when, indeed, I have been proud and said, “My Love, my own.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day’s Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\" The student may give either title during their recitation.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers Plucked in the garden, all the summer through And winter, and it seemed as if they grew In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers, So, in the like name of that love of ours, Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too, And which on warm and cold days I withdrew From my heart’s ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue, And wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine, Here’s ivy!— take them, as I used to do Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine. Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true, And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I lift my heavy heart up solemnly, As once Electra her sepulchral urn, And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see What a great heap of grief lay hid in me, And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn Could tread them out to darkness utterly, It might be well perhaps. But if instead Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow The grey dust up,... those laurels on thine head, O My beloved, will not shield thee so, That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred The hair beneath. Stand further off then! Go.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore Alone upon the threshold of my door Of individual life, I shall command The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand Serenely in the sunshine as before, Without the sense of that which I forbore, .. Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine With pulses that beat double. What I do And what I dream include thee, as the wine Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue God for myself, He hears that name of thine, And sees within my eyes, the tears of two.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The face of all the world is changed, I think, Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink, Was caught up into love, and taught the whole Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink, And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear. The names of country, heaven, are changed away For where thou art or shalt be, there or here; And this ... this lute and song ... loved yesterday, (The singing angels know) are only dear, Because thy name moves right in what they say.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
LOVING friend, the gift of one, Who, her own true faith, hath run, Through thy lower nature ; Be my benediction said With my hand upon thy head, Gentle fellow-creature ! Like a lady's ringlets brown, Flow thy silken ears adown Either side demurely, Of thy silver-suited breast Shining out from all the rest Of thy body purely. Darkly brown thy body is, Till the sunshine, striking this, Alchemize its dulness, — When the sleek curls manifold Flash all over into gold, With a burnished fulness. Underneath my stroking hand, Startled eyes of hazel bland Kindling, growing larger, — Up thou leapest with a spring, Full of prank and curvetting, Leaping like a charger. Leap ! thy broad tail waves a light ; Leap ! thy slender feet are bright, Canopied in fringes. Leap — those tasselled ears of thine Flicker strangely, fair and fine, Down their golden inches Yet, my pretty sportive friend, Little is 't to such an end That I praise thy rareness ! Other dogs may be thy peers Haply in these drooping ears, And this glossy fairness. But of thee it shall be said, This dog watched beside a bed Day and night unweary, — Watched within a curtained room, Where no sunbeam brake the gloom Round the sick and dreary. Roses, gathered for a vase, In that chamber died apace, Beam and breeze resigning — This dog only, waited on, Knowing that when light is gone, Love remains for shining. Other dogs in thymy dew Tracked the hares and followed through Sunny moor or meadow — This dog only, crept and crept Next a languid cheek that slept, Sharing in the shadow. Other dogs of loyal cheer Bounded at the whistle clear, Up the woodside hieing — This dog only, watched in reach Of a faintly uttered speech, Or a louder sighing. And if one or two quick tears Dropped upon his glossy ears, Or a sigh came double, — Up he sprang in eager haste, Fawning, fondling, breathing fast, In a tender trouble. And this dog was satisfied, If a pale thin hand would glide, Down his dewlaps sloping, — Which he pushed his nose within, After, — platforming his chin On the palm left open. This dog, if a friendly voice Call him now to blyther choice Than such chamber-keeping, Come out ! ' praying from the door, — Presseth backward as before, Up against me leaping. Therefore to this dog will I, Tenderly not scornfully, Render praise and favour ! With my hand upon his head, Is my benediction said Therefore, and for ever. And because he loves me so, Better than his kind will do Often, man or woman, Give I back more love again Than dogs often take of men, — Leaning from my Human. Blessings on thee, dog of mine, Pretty collars make thee fine, Sugared milk make fat thee ! Pleasures wag on in thy tail — Hands of gentle motion fail Nevermore, to pat thee ! Downy pillow take thy head, Silken coverlid bestead, Sunshine help thy sleeping ! No fly 's buzzing wake thee up — No man break thy purple cup, Set for drinking deep in. Whiskered cats arointed flee — Sturdy stoppers keep from thee Cologne distillations ; Nuts lie in thy path for stones, And thy feast-day macaroons Turn to daily rations ! Mock I thee, in wishing weal ? — Tears are in my eyes to feel Thou art made so straightly, Blessing needs must straighten too, — Little canst thou joy or do, Thou who lovest greatly. Yet be blessed to the height Of all good and all delight Pervious to thy nature, — Only loved beyond that line, With a love that answers thine, Loving fellow-creature !@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Amidst the days of pleasant mirth,That throw their halo round our earth;Amidst the tender thoughts that riseTo call bright tears to happy eyes;Amidst the silken words that moveTo syllable the names we love;There glides no day of gentle blissMore soothing to the heart than this!No thoughts of fondness e'er appearMore fond, than those I write of here!No name can e'er on tablet shine,My father! more beloved than thine!'Tis sweet, adown the shady past,A lingering look of love to cast—Back th' enchanted world to call,That beamed around us first of all;And walk with Memory fondly o'erThe paths where Hope had been before—Sweet to receive the sylphic soundThat breathes in tenderness around,Repeating to the listening earThe names that made our childhood dear—For parted Joy, like Echo, kind,Will leave her dulcet voice behind,To tell, amidst the magic air,How oft she smiled and lingered there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Great is thy pow'r, an' great thy fame; Far ken'd an' noted is thy name; An' tho' yon lowin heugh's thy hame, Thou travels far; An' faith! thou's neither lag nor lame, Nor blate nor scaur. Whyles, ranging like a roarin lion, For prey a' holes an' corners tryin; Whyles, on the strong-wing'd tempest flyin, Tirlin' the kirks; Whyles, in the human bosom pryin, Unseen thou lurks. I've heard my rev'rend graunie say, In lanely glens ye like to stray; Or whare auld ruin'd castles gray Nod to the moon, Ye fright the nightly wand'rer's way Wi' eldritch croon. When twilight did my graunie summon To say her pray'rs, douce honest woman! Aft yont the dike she's heard you bummin, Wi' eerie drone; Or, rustlin thro' the boortrees comin, Wi' heavy groan. Ae dreary, windy, winter night, The stars shot down wi' sklentin light, Wi' you mysel I gat a fright, Ayont the lough; Ye like a rash-buss stood in sight, Wi' waving sugh. The cudgel in my nieve did shake, Each bristl'd hair stood like a stake, When wi' an eldritch, stoor \"Quaick, quaick,\" Amang the springs, Awa ye squatter'd like a drake, On whistling wings.

Thence, mystic knots mak great abuse, On young guidmen, fond, keen, an' croose; When the best wark-lume i' the house, By cantraip wit, Is instant made no worth a louse, Just at the bit. When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord, An' float the jinglin icy-boord, Then water-kelpies haunt the foord By your direction, An' nighted trav'lers are allur'd To their destruction. And aft your moss-traversing spunkies Decoy the wight that late an drunk is: The bleezin, curst, mischievous monkeys Delude his eyes, Till in some miry slough he sunk is, Ne'er mair to rise. When Masons' mystic word an grip In storms an' tempests raise you up, Some cock or cat your rage maun stop, Or, strange to tell! The youngest brither ye wad whip Aff straught to hell! Lang syne, in Eden'd bonie yard, When youthfu' lovers first were pair'd, An all the soul of love they shar'd, The raptur'd hour, Sweet on the fragrant flow'ry swaird, In shady bow'r; Then you, ye auld snick-drawin dog! Ye cam to Paradise incog, And play'd on man a cursed brogue, (Black be your fa'!) An gied the infant warld a shog, Maist ruin'd a'.

But a' your doings to rehearse, Your wily snares an' fechtin fierce, Sin' that day Michael did you pierce, Down to this time, Wad ding a Lallan tongue, or Erse, In prose or rhyme.

Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes, Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise; My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream, Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream. Thou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro' the glen, Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den, Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear, I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair. How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills, Far mark'd with the courses of clear winding rills; There daily I wander as noon rises high, My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye. How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below, Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow; There oft, as mild Ev'ning sweeps over the lea, The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me. Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides, And winds by the cot where my Mary resides, How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave, As gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave. Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes, Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays; My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream, Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We'll gae down by Cluden side, Thro' the hazels spreading wide, O'er the waves that sweetly glide To the moon sae clearly.

Is there, for honest poverty, That hings his head, an' a' that? The coward slave, we pass him by, We dare be poor for a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Our toils obscure, an' a' that; The rank is but the guinea's stamp; The man's the gowd for a' that, What tho' on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin-gray, an' a' that; Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, A man's a man for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, Their tinsel show an' a' that; The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that. Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that; Tho' hundreds worship at his word, He's but a coof for a' that: For a' that, an' a' that, His riband, star, an' a' that, The man o' independent mind, He looks and laughs at a' that. A prince can mak a belted knight, A marquis, duke, an' a' that; But an honest man's aboon his might, Guid faith he mauna fa' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Their dignities, an' a' that, The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth, Are higher rank than a' that. Then let us pray that come it may, As come it will for a' that, That sense and worth, o'er a' the earth, May bear the gree, an' a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, It's coming yet, for a' that, That man to man, the warld o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain, She's gotten poets o' her ain— Chiels wha their chanters winna hain, But tune their lays, Till echoes a' resound again Her weel-sung praise. Nae poet thought her worth his while To set her name in measur'd style: She lay like some unken'd-of isle Beside New Holland, Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil Besouth Magellan. Ramsay and famous Fergusson Gied Forth and Tay a lift aboon; Yarrow and Tweed to mony a tune Owre Scotland rings; While Irvin, Lugar, Ayr an' Doon Naebody sings. Th' Ilissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine Glide sweet in mony a tunefu' line; But, Willie, set your fit to mine And cock your crest, We'll gar our streams and burnies shine Up wi' the best! We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells, Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells, Her banks an' braes, her dens an' dells, Where glorious Wallace Aft bure the gree, as story tells, Frae Southron billies. At Wallace' name what Scottish blood But boils up in a spring-tide flood! Oft have our fearless fathers strode By Wallace' side, Still pressing onward red-wat-shod, Or glorious dy'd. O sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,. When lintwhites chant amang the buds, And jinkin hares in amorous whids Their loves enjoy, While thro' the braes the cushat croods Wi' wailfu' cry! Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me, When winds rave thro' the naked tree; Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree Are hoary gray; Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee, Dark'ning the day! O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms! Whether the summer kindly warms Wi' life an' light, Or winter howls in gusty storms The lang, dark night! The Muse, nae poet ever fand her, Till by himsel he learn'd to wander Adoun some trottin burn's meander, And no think lang; O sweet to stray and pensive ponder A heart-felt sang! The warly race may drudge and drive, Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch an' strive: Let me fair nature's face descrive, And I wi' pleasure Shall let the busy, grumbling hive Bum owre their treasure.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Ye banks, and braes, and streams around The castle o' Montgomery, Green be your woods, and fair your flowers, Your waters never drumlie! There Simmer first unfald her robes, And there the langest tarry: For there I took the last Fareweel O' my sweet Highland Mary. How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk, How rich the hawthorn's blossom; As underneath their fragrant shade, I clasp'd her to my bosom! The golden Hours, on angel wings, Flew o'er me and my Dearie; For dear to me as light and life Was my sweet Highland Mary. Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace, Our parting was fu' tender; And pledging aft to meet again, We tore oursels asunder: But Oh! fell Death's untimely frost, That nipt my Flower sae early! Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay, That wraps my Highland Mary! O pale, pale now, those rosy lips, I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly! And clos'd for ay the sparkling glance, That dwalt on me sae kindly! And mouldering now in silent dust, That heart that lo'ed me dearly! But still within my bosom's core Shall live my Highland Mary.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Last May a braw wooer cam down the lang glen, And sair wi' his love he did deave me; I said there was naething I hated like men: The deuce gae wi 'm to believe me, believe me, The deuce gae wi 'm to believe me. He spak o' the darts in my bonie black een, And vow'd for my love he was diein; I said he might die when he liked for Jean: The Lord forgie me for liein, for liein, The Lord forgie me for liein! A weel-stocked mailen, himsel for the laird, And marriage aff-hand, were his proffers: I never loot on that I ken'd it, or car'd, But thought I might hae waur offers, waur offers, But thought I might hae waur offers. But what wad ye think? in a fortnight or less, (The deil tak his taste to gae near her!) He up the lang loan to my black cousin Bess, Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her, could bear her Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her. But a' the niest week I fretted wi' care, I gaed to the tryste o' Dalgarnock, And wha but my fine fickle lover was there, I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock. I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock. But owre my left shoulder I gae him a blink, Lest neibors might say I was saucy; My wooer he caper'd as he'd been in drink, And vow'd I was his dear lassie, dear lassie, And vow'd I was his dear lassie. I spier'd for my cousin fu' couthy and sweet, Gin she had recover'd her hearin, And how her new shoon fit her auld shachl't feet— But, heavens! how he fell a swearin, a swearin, But, heavens! how he fell a swearin. He begg'd, for gudesake, I wad be his wife, Or else I wad kill him wi' sorrow: So e'en to preserve the poor body in life, I think I maun wed him to-morrow, to-morrow, I think I maun wed him to-morrow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

When chapman billies leave the street, And drouthy neebors neebors meet, As market-days are wearing late, And folk begin to tak the gate; While we sit bousin, at the nappy, And gettin fou and unco happy, We think na on the lang Scots miles, The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles, That lie between us and our hame, Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame, Gathering her brows like gathering storm, Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter, As he frae Ayr ae night did canter: (Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses, For honest men and bonie lasses.) O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice! She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, A bletherin, blusterin, drunken blellum; That frae November till October, Ae market-day thou was na sober; That ilka melder wi' the miller, Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on, The smith and thee gat roarin fou on; That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday, Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday. She prophesied, that, late or soon, Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon; Ot catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk, By Alloway's auld haunted kirk. Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet, To think how mony counsels sweet, How mony lengthen'd sage advices, The husband frae the wife despises! But to our tale:—Ae market night, Tam had got planted unco right, Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, Wi' reaming swats that drank divinely; And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony: Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither; They had been fou for weeks thegither. The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter; And ay the ale was growing better: The landlady and Tam grew gracious Wi' secret favours, sweet, and precious: The souter tauld his queerest stories; The landlord's laugh was ready chorus: The storm without might rair and rustle, Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. Care, mad to see a man sae happy, E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy: As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure, The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure; Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious, O'er a' the ills o' life victorious! But pleasures are like poppies spread, You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white—then melts forever; Or like the borealis race, That flit ere you can point their place; Or like the rainbow's lovely form Evanishing amid the storm. Nae man can tether time or tide: The hour approaches Tam maun ride,— That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane That dreary hour he mounts his beast in; And sic a night he taks the road in, As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in. The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last; The rattling show'rs rose on the blast; The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd; Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellow'd: That night, a child might understand, The Deil had business on his hand. Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,— A better never lifted leg,— Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire, Despising wind and rain and fire; Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet, Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet, Whiles glowrin round wi' prudent cares, Lest bogles catch him unawares. Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry. By this time he was cross the ford, Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd; And past the birks and meikle stane, Whare drucken Charlie brak's neckbane: And thro' the whins, and by the cairn, Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn; And near the thorn, aboon the well, Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel. Before him Doon pours all his floods; The doubling storm roars thro' the woods; The lightnings flash from pole to pole, Near and more near the thunders roll; When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees, Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze: Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, And loud resounded mirth and dancing. Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! What dangers thou can'st make us scorn! Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil; Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil! The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle. But Magg@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Wee, modest, crimson-tippèd flow'r, Thou's met me in an evil hour; For I maun crush amang the stoure Thy slender stem: To spare thee now is past my pow'r, Thou bonie gem. Alas! it's no thy neibor sweet, The bonie lark, companion meet, Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet Wi' spreck'd breast, When upward-springing, blythe, to greet The purpling east. Cauld blew the bitter-biting north Upon thy early, humble birth; Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth Amid the storm, Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth Thy tender form. The flaunting flowers our gardens yield High shelt'ring woods an' wa's maun shield: But thou, beneath the random bield O' clod or stane, Adorns the histie stibble-field Unseen, alane. There, in thy scanty mantle clad, Thy snawie-bosom sun-ward spread, Thou lifts thy unassuming head In humble guise; But now the share uptears thy bed, And low thou lies! Such is the fate of artless maid, Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade! By love's simplicity betray'd And guileless trust; Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid Low i' the dust. Such is the fate of simple bard, On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd! Unskilful he to note the card Of prudent lore, Till billows rage and gales blow hard, And whelm him o'er! Such fate to suffering Worth is giv'n, Who long with wants and woes has striv'n, By human pride or cunning driv'n To mis'ry's brink; Till, wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n, He ruin'd sink! Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate, That fate is thine—no distant date; Stern Ruin's ploughshare drives elate, Full on thy bloom, Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight Shall be thy doom.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

George Borrow in his Lavengro Tells us of a Welshman, who By some excess of mother-wit Framed a harp and played on it, Built a ship and sailed to sea, And steered it home to melody Of his own making. I, indeed, Might write for Everyman to read A thaumalogue of wonderment More wonderful, but rest content With celebrating one I knew Who built his pipes, and played them, too: No more. Ah, played! Therein is all: The hounded thing, the hunter's call; The shudder, when the quarry's breath Is drowned in blood and stilled in death; The marriage dance, the pulsing vein, The kiss that must be given again; The hope that Ireland, like a rose, Sees shining thro' her tale of woes; The battle lost, the long lament For blood and spirit vainly spent; And so on, thro' the varying scale Of passion that the western Gael Knows, and by miracle of art Draws to the chanter from the heart Like water from a hidden spring, To leap or murmur, weep or sing. I see him now, a little man In proper black, whey-bearded, wan, With eyes that scan the eastern hills Thro' thick, gold-rimmèd spectacles. His hand is on the chanter. Lo, The hidden spring begins to flow In waves of magic. (He is dead These seven years, but bend your head And listen.) Rising from the clay The Master plays The Ring of Day. It mounts and falls and floats away Over the sky-line . . . then is gone Into the silence of the dawn!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

They had questioned him for hours. Who exactly was he? And when He told them, they questioned him again. When they accepted who he was, as Someone not involved, they pulled out his fingernails. Then They took him to a waste-ground somewhere near the Horseshoe Bend, and told him What he was. They shot him nine times. A dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres. The bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself. Broken glass and knotted Durex. The knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking.

What did I do? For what reward? Or in a catacomb deep under Paris they press gloves of barbed wire on to my bare hands, and when the wounds have healed they point to the brambles left on my palms, saying, Surely these lines of head and heart and mind are those of a traitor. When you wake I hold you tight, saying, It’s only a dream, the language of dream has nothing to do with that of life. And as eventually you sink back into the deep well of sleep, I wonder if by my words I have betrayed you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I woke. You were lying beside me in the double bed, prone, your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow. I’d been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over. Knit one, purl two, you said. Something in your voice made me think of women knitting by the guillotine. Your eyes met mine. The fetch of a wave is the distance it travels, you said, from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore. I must go back to where it all began. You waded in thigh-deep, waist-deep, breast-deep, head-deep, until you disappeared. I lay there and thought how glad I was to find you again. You stirred in the bed and moaned something. I heard a footfall on the landing, the rasp of a man’s cough. He put his head around the door. He had my face. I woke. You were not there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The Powers-that-Be decreed that from the—of—the sausage rolls, for reasons Of security, would be contracted to a different firm. They gave the prisoners no reasons. The prisoners complained. We cannot reproduce his actual words here, since their spokesman is alleged To be a sub-commander of a movement deemed to be illegal. An actor spoke for him in almost-perfect lip-synch: It’s not the quality We’re giving off about. Just that it seems they’re getting smaller. We’re talking quantity. His ‘Belfast’ accent wasn’t West enough. Is the H in H-Block aitch or haitch? Does it matter? What we have we hold? Our day will come? Give or take an inch? Well, give an inch and someone takes an effing mile. Everything is in the ways You say them. Like, the prison that we call Long Kesh is to the Powers-that-Be The Maze.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It was overcast. No hour at all was indicated by the gnomon. With difficulty I made out the slogan, Time and tide wait for no man. I had been waiting for you, Daphne, underneath the dripping laurels, near The sundial glade where first we met. I felt like Hamlet on the parapets of Elsinore, Alerted to the ectoplasmic moment, when Luna rends her shroud of cloud And sails into a starry archipelago. Then your revenant appeared and spake aloud: I am not who you think I am. For what we used to be is gone. The moment’s over, Whatever years you thought we spent together. You don’t know the story. And moreover, You mistook the drinking-fountain for a sundial. I put my lips to its whatever, And with difficulty I made out the slogan, Drink from me and you shall live forever.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Forget the corncrake’s elegy. Rusty Iambics that escaped your discipline Of shorn lawns, it is sustained by nature. It does not grieve for you, nor for itself. You remember the rolled gold of cornfields, Their rustling of tinsel in the wind, A whole field quivering like blown silk? A shiver now runs through the laurel hedge, And washing flutters like the swaying lines Of a new verse. The high fidelity Music of the newly-wed obscures your Dedication to a life of loving Money. What could they be for, those marble Toilet fixtures, the silence of water-beds, That book of poems you bought yesterday?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You remember the Incredible Shrinking Man? I said. Well, last night I dreamed I was him. It began the same way. The shirt cuffs were the first thing that came to my attention, drooping down over my knuckles in the bedroom mirror. And my waistband and shoes were getting looser by the day. Within weeks you could perch me on your knee like a male doll. Later you would put me to bed in the empty matchbox. You failed to watch for the spider that came to explore me. I fought her with a darning needle, a button my shield. She retreated from me on a thread. I followed her down to the cellar. How I made my way back I’ll never know. It took me days to travel over the quilt to your hand. No longer a hand but an Alpine range of sleeping flesh. I crawled into an open pore and entered your bloodstream.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Take some broad-shouldered little fart, at las- t, fresh from the 5 o’clock (morn) shadow of barbarism, squatting over barley-paste, hot goat, dried fig (meal the shadow — since the shadows were removed from rocky Grecian hills, trees cut away, soil reduced to olive grounds — down to shadow of surroundings — of Homeric heaps of meat that cast deadanimal-shaped shadows by the tents on the sandy shores of Ilium) squatting over his shapeless shadow in the shadow of the Parthenon — itself shadow form from wood, “in the light of” stone. Well now, there’s been some organized ruckus in his medium, rare town, which, God knows, nobody there “thought” would survive, a golden paradigm, for thousands of Apollonian twirls.

Summer was a-comin’ in still (Lawdy! sing coo-coo!), facts & symbols be-danced & babblin’ beat of a million bovine feet upon the tender luxury sidewinding from the brain. So he thought “Thought!” Why not? Natural! in a sense. Never before had such perfect innocence been explored like new property. Well, such a new idea as “idea” looks pretty good till you can check out how it settles into the ground. Blood’s biodegradable but logos piled up like a plastic eyesore, fore- shadowed a bloodless dry reign, precipitation of pedestrain pedantry, pedestrian mind for millenia, postulating its pustulations of post- & pre-, professing everything, subjugating us all in the tick-tech burned-out success of a nob objectivity, turning babble to a soapy bubble up up & away until pop! goes the wizard. Aw c’mon, the alchemy that pilfers from golden sundance volumes of German silver sucks tongue of essence — ah yes, essence, with its can-do incandescence, like “Lovelight’s our leverage to spring some uptight average from alla this quotidian sewage & italicize it, boot it through the uprights to an airy footnote.” So anyway this guy imagined up God outa the play-dough of his panicked exclusions & then compounded the felony by trying to imitate the damn thing, double-indemnity solipsism in the fool’s guise of cool & wise utopian Republic!

Nick the landlord didn’t show (he was supposed to have us sign lease on the new duplex) (this place gonna be torn down). ate a very delicious supper, ham-and-cheese rarebit with cold broccoli and cold oregano’d tomato, cooked by Mara. paperwork, played a game of solitaire, harried by Sierra’s new red car. dropped over then to the Korner Bar, put up a poster under the phone sign, said hi to a few folks and got halloo’d by this guy I’d spoken to 2 months before, who’d said his high school son adored me, but it might be thought improper that I hang around, shoot pool in Korner Bar. a beefy mid-30’s man, he bought me a beer, apologized and told me of his luck: he’d won a thousand one-hundred eighty dollars today betting on one horse at Fonner Park. we talked of poetry, family, work — he mentioned Kilmer, Stevenson, Nash and others, quoted verbatim his own published poem on fire-fighting (he is the G.I. fire-chief). his boyhood favorites, whom he reads all of even now: Edgar Rice Burroughts and Jules Verne. his son, though epileptic, does the high jump at the high school; he was disturbed that it wasn’t the broad jump, in which he himself still holds a record, set in 1959. the taxes have jumped up like crazy on their nice spread just inside the city limits. I got up and slapped him on the back and left, stopping first to ask Clark, standing end of the bar, what he knew of me on Friday night at the Kyriss. I’d blanked out completely (woke up in jail, ate blue oatmeal). he said I’d just got drunk, he thought Rod had taken me home. he said, at one point, just waking up, I’d grabbed the edge of the table and tilted it till the glasses all came sliding down and almost off, then tilted it back till they slid back to where they were, and never spilled a drop. he said I’d bought some beers for him and Pat but before they could get to them drank them up myself. okay, Clark, you’re a good guy with your black curly hair and toothless grin, and your wild life. I was just wondering. check with Rod when have a chance. — and off, through mud and occasionally-lighted puddles, home, where Mara’s napping still and there are (were) 5 Lucky Bocks in the white (today!) icebox. 9:50.

His beard: an avalanche of honey, an avalanche of thorns. In a bar too close to the Pacific, he said, “I don’t love you, but not because I couldn’t be attracted to you.” Liar— even my soul is potbellied. Thinness, in my mind, equals the gay men on the nightly news. Kissed by death & public scorn. The anchorman declaring, “Weight loss is one of the first symptoms.” The Portuguese have a word for imaginary, never- to-be-experienced love. Whoop-de-doo. “I don’t love you,” he said. The words flung him back— in his eyes, I saw it— to another bar where a woman sidestepped his desire. Another hunger. Our friendship. In tenth grade, weeks after my first kiss, my mother said, “You’re looking thinner.” That evening, I smuggled a cake into my room. I ate it with my hands, licked buttercream off my thumbs until I puked. Desire with no future, bitter longing— I starve myself by yearning for intimacy that doesn’t & won’t exist. Holding hands on a ferry. Tracing, with the tip of my tongue, a jawline. In a bar too close to the Pacific, he said, “I don’t love you, but not because I couldn’t be attracted to you.” His beard: an avalanche of thorns, an avalanche of honey.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Bought my luck. Rabbit’s foot. Hiked through paloverde. Thick heat. Bullet holes in cacti. Rested by a ditch. Sand littered with used tampons. Took off my sneakers. Ants crisscrossed my feet. Sandal straps. Passed around crackers. Tuna cans. Mustard & ketchup packets. Trekked over three hills. Dashed across a dirt road. Nearly stepped on a diamondback. Quiet coil. Squatted under mesquite. Drank hot water. Tried to forget the plazas of Hermosillo. Rose bushes. Roasted cashews. Tried to remember my uncle’s phone number. A butcher in Iowa. Ames. Walked toward a mountain. Coolness fell through the heat. Guillotine. Rested. Fought off the oldest smuggler. Yellow teeth. Gums pink as horse cock. Woke with some Portuguese in my head. A morte nos absorve inteiramente.

In the desert, the moonshivers. Tonight, to stay awake, I’ll cut my feet with glass.Outside Oaxaca, in a clinic, my mother said, “I hate your Indian face.”In the dream I’m running. My limbs skeletal and scabbed.After my mother’s death, I found, in a box, her wedding dress.As I lifted the lid, a stench corkscrewed into my nostrils:the dress had curdled like milk. During the day I gather tinder.Paper. Shed snakeskin. When the last light above the mountainsknots into stars, I crouch under mesquite,make a fire.Sometimes the moon stops shivering. Sometimes I tally what I owe.In the dream I’m running through a hallway. The floor uneven.The walls green. Last month, as my son blew out the candleson his cake, I noticed, for the first time, the hideous shapeof his nose. Tonight I’ll pinch my thighs to stay awake. My mother,in the clinic, said, “The rain has a fever, it needs plentyof rest, it needs to drink plenty of water.” The doctor scribbled in a filethen asked for more money. If my mother could see me now!My feet bloody. My face darker than ever. Tonight, to stay awake,I’ll sit close to the fire.

All zodiac all radar your voice I carried it across the Atlantic to Barcelona I photographed cathedrals cacti mosaic salamanders I even photo- graphed my lust always your voice skimming a woman’s skin mattress springs so noisy so birdlike you filled her room with cages camera bright in my pocket map unfolding in my mind I explored a park leaves notched & enormous graffitied boulders then three men tall & clean closed in they broke open my body with their fists insufferable your red wool cap insufferable the way you walked away from me come back please the buttons on your jacket are finches I wanted to yell as you vanished into a hotel to drink with your friends there was nothing more you could do after my attackers left before I got up I touched my face almost tenderly@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I only recognized your hair: short,neatly combed. Our motherwould’ve been proud. In the Sonoran desertyour body became a slaughter-house where faith and want were stunned,hung upside down, gutted. We were taughtto bring roses, to aim for the bush. Remember?You tried to porka girl’s armpit. In Border Patrol jargon, the wordfor border crossers is the same whether they’re alive or dead.When I read his flesh felloff the bones, my stomach rumbled, my mouthwatered. Yesterday, our mother said, “My high heels are killing me.Let’s go back to the funeral.” You were alwaysher favorite. Slow cooking a roastmelts the tough tissue between the muscle fibers;tender meat remains. Remember the timeI caught you pissing on a dog? You turnedaway from me. In the small of your backI thought I saw a face. Split lip,broken nose. It was a mask. I yanked it from your flesh. I wear it often.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I gave you a tiny box. You lifted the lid, praised the usefulness of my gift: a silver pin shaped like an amper-sand. As you fastened it to your lapel, I thought again of that motel outside of Chicago. ¿Te acuerdas?I sat on the edge of a bench, untied my shoes. Face down, eyes shut, you breathed inthe aroma of sweat & allspice coming off the sheets. I tossed my ring—gold, inscribed—toward a pile of clothes. But the ring dropped in the small of your back where it rattled & rattled like a coin in a beggar’s cup.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
All that glitters isn’t music.Once, hidden in tall grass, I tossed fistfuls of dirt into the air:doe after doe of leaping. You said it was nothing but a trick of the light. Gold curves. Gold scarves. Am I not your animal?You’d wait in the orchard for hours to watch a deerbreak from the shadows.You said it was like lifting a cello out of its black case.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

When one thing is becoming another, when writing is morphing, when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night, fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing; typewriters, even a nib and ink well, and considering all the ways of stretching a space, digital or hard copy; hard copy, an ugly expression for printed matter, and for that matter, printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty. Page, a soft and elongated word; page, an extension at the end of my fingers; page, a screen that holds dreams and desires; the page of legal document that bind. The page is a promise. I read all sides, turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what I may have missed. Desire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid. The pen is a body, an anatomy, not an earthworm with indecipherable ends; the pen has a head and tail, and inky guts. And the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks. later hours/another hour/late hours/early hours/happy hour/visiting hours. All the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop, in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery. Finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses, but I know the nest is early paper, the raw ingredients and pulp. I know the world is a page turner, a paper globe, and I know that the birds are the great writers of the sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How do you recognize a lovely place? The rotten anthropology of superheroes hovers above the conference table, exhausted on the idea of dazzling people. A plugged organization of the moon like a turnpike undecorated by barely legal children — true stories end in the moody doctor city but I always say the wrong thing. Away from Las Vegas I spend too much time at the whale facility. I’m bored with awakening into historical X-rays of the NO MOMENT. (What showmanship!) Who does wear a cape underwater? Now Egypt is miniaturized and it may never rain again. Hurling bodies and collapsing lungs used to be honestly scripted activities — the stillness in the dream of important history. From now on your stillness will be happening. In the actual dream remember how the children were modified, the sputtering, Russel Crotty language? Friendly Calliope is no longer remedial in the crisply American landscape. Even snowy Vermont grows opaque, a diminished suggestion in the desert mirror. I feel as if I’m speaking to a dear friend but I’m saying the wrong things. I don’t like cockfights or you’d rather be my daughter, deeply, authentically factualizing our especially Southern roots.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My fugues have no apparent relation to past trauma of any kind. When it came time to rehearse we decided to get glamorous. We get all done-up for rehearsal. Gradually, imperceptibly, things begin slipping back into their normal place. My body is slowly rotating into its proper north-south orientation. My playing is flawless as it turns out. The audience goes nuts but what was it all about? Had I longer to see the aspects and facets of the family, which as we know are not always tickety-boo but I have drifted away like a wide-winged bird over many things that are meaningless, yet my mind is clicking away quite properly on other levels. I was never in it for the money, but I see where it goes without ever touching it. It was like a honeymoon — nothing made sense, sounding utterly convincing to my own ears — selfness in training, needing a month of good sleep. When I woke I saw the sunlight streaming in across the ceiling and thought oh boy, we were awful yesterday, the obvious response being to phone the boss and tell him you’re sick and go to bed until it’s passed, except Boss is in bed too. Don’t let the lack of his spirit blind your life. You would expect me to tell you, wouldn’t you, if our positions were reversed, while I look for a suitable shirt, but you don’t have any more to accomplish, nothing at all. Did you ever love me? Could I grit my teeth and carry it all off without anyone being the wiser? Any words that have concrete meanings are fine and completely friendly. The whole history of the human race is somewhat sad, wouldn’t you say, if you look at it in a certain way? But then, if you squint a bit differently it isn’t sad at all. There were times we were all hurting really bad, thinking the bed will win. Maybe it was the beginnings of trademark — if we stayed telepathic we couldn’t do that — surprise, surprise, and that’s how we decided to do the dance and that’s how The Dance came about. There was a large, grassy clearing in the forest, the trees around it thick and tall and there was sunlight on the grass. We knew that people were worshipping and the way they did it was to gather around a place like this and allow themselves to become a part of it, greeting it and letting it greet them feeding their bodies to their souls, the pity of the tribe was how we imagined it, seeing behind closed eyelids a lovely scene, looking down from an open balcony into a central courtyard. We were in a place that appeared to consist of baskets of flowers. I could see only the top of his brown hair and his moving hands. There’s a lot of color. It’s more noticeable than usual — I mean there are little prisms, rainbows everywhere but whether it was guitar or piano I couldn’t tell you — this is pre-Lindsey. The back room was vicious, everyone on a different drug. If you turned your back you’d better keep on walking. We did this every night, playing country rock at the height of glitter, mixed-bag material. We needed theoretical problems! My back to him, I said, “You mean us poor, sad little cast-offs, wouldn’t it be nice if we could cheer each other up so our miser wouldn’t cast a pall on the happiness of the Prince and Princess?” Only I’m foreshadowing with picky surfaces. The morals are contemporary — argument of sounds, accomodation, implosion, but still the ineffable grace of seeming perishable — the ordinariness of making love and hearing music. I’m okay by myself, believe me. It’s a thought that gives rise to immense self-compassion. Okay, I’ll deal with this. I kind of went on the skids. It was just the four of us finally starting to crank it out, faster and faster, until it was too fast. Then one day, it was a Friday, always payday and I was in the bedroom beginning to sort out what I thought of as my shitpile, a collection of such things as dresses, belts, stockings, photographs, and old magazines all waiting to be put where they belong.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He knows how to do what he sets out to do with perfectly obvious procedure. The sea is dark and forbidding. The horizon is dark and forbidding. Even from a distance, the less said the better. The colors in some of these landscapes are perfectly desperate. In a portrait there is never anything wrong with the mouth. There is never anything wrong with anything. Machines are not choosers. The next best things are certain. Heaven knowing the next best things. The young can explain it, but who would they explain it to? More promise than performance as all sorts of things begin to interfere. An energetic hostess seated me at the counter next to a beautiful woman. It is possible the timid portion of the population unless held firmly in check will imitate the silliness of timid people of years ago. Supplication is valued. As soon as I learned the facts I gave up on the exchange. She wanted something mysterious, as if everything were the same. Life changes and so-called truth changes with it. The businesslike haste of the surgeon as he scolds the public. To look at him and the thing he can never look at shudderingly as the blood is drawn is the duty of every patriot. In a constructive age such as this I should have neglected everything for the supreme duty of aiding in the reconstruction. I took my courage, which starts everywhere and goes nowhere, and spoke to her. Here one can unquestionably infer the inside from the outside. The leaders of the free world, assembled as if by magic, seem to have the enemy at their mercy. It can be argued that Christ himself spoke to the mob. The crowd will stop to see almost anything. The crowd will stop to see something about almost everything.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The poet pursues his beautiful theme; The preacher his golden beatitude; And I run after a vanishing dream— The glittering, will-o’-the-wispish gleam Of the properly scholarly attitude— The highly desirable, the very advisable, The hardly acquirable, properly scholarly attitude. I envy the savage without any clothes, Who lives in a tropical latitude; It’s little of general culture he knows. But then he escapes the worrisome woes Of the properly scholarly attitude— The unceasingly sighed over, wept over, cried over, The futilely died over, properly scholarly attitude. I work and I work till I nearly am dead, And could say what the watchman said—that I could! But still, with a sigh and a shake of the head, “You don’t understand,” it is ruthlessly said, “The properly scholarly attitude— The aye to be sought for, wrought for and fought for, The ne’er to be caught for, properly scholarly attitude—” I really am sometimes tempted to say That it’s merely a glittering platitude; That people have just fallen into the way, When lacking a subject, to tell of the sway Of the properly scholarly attitude— The easily preachable, spread-eagle speechable, In practice unreachable, properly scholarly attitude.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: \"Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest.\" I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end; \"Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are.\" And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

.... O heart, the equal poise of love’s both parts, Big alike with wounds and darts, Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same, And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame; Live here, great heart, and love and die and kill, And bleed and wound, and yield and conquer still. Let this immortal life, where’er it comes, Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms; Let mystic deaths wait on ’t, and wise souls be The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee. O sweet incendiary! show here thy art, Upon this carcass of a hard cold heart, Let all thy scatter’d shafts of light, that play Among the leaves of thy large books of day, Combin’d against this breast, at once break in And take away from me my self and sin; This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be, And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me. O thou undaunted daughter of desires! By all thy dow’r of lights and fires, By all the eagle in thee, all the dove, By all thy lives and deaths of love, By thy large draughts of intellectual day, And by thy thirsts of love more large than they, By all thy brim-fill’d bowls of fierce desire, By thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire, By the full kingdom of that final kiss That seiz’d thy parting soul and seal’d thee his, By all the heav’ns thou hast in him, Fair sister of the seraphim! By all of him we have in thee, Leave nothing of my self in me: Let me so read thy life that I Unto all life of mine may die.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Love, thou are absolute sole lord Of life and death. To prove the word, We’ll now appeal to none of all Those thy old soldiers, great and tall, Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down With strong arms their triumphant crown; Such as could with lusty breath Speak loud into the face of death Their great Lord’s glorious name; to none Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne For love at large to fill; spare blood and sweat, And see him take a private seat, Making his mansion in the mild And milky soul of a soft child. Scarce has she learn’d to lisp the name Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame Life should so long play with that breath Which spent can buy so brave a death. She never undertook to know What death with love should have to do; Nor has she e’er yet understood Why to show love she should shed blood; Yet though she cannot tell you why, She can love, and she can die. Scarce has she blood enough to make A guilty sword blush for her sake; Yet has she’a heart dares hope to prove How much less strong is death than love. Be love but there, let poor six years Be pos’d with the maturest fears Man trembles at, you straight shall find Love knows no nonage, nor the mind. ’Tis love, not years or limbs that can Make the martyr, or the man. Love touch’d her heart, and lo it beats High, and burns with such brave heats, Such thirsts to die, as dares drink up A thousand cold deaths in one cup. Good reason, for she breathes all fire; Her weak breast heaves with strong desire Of what she may with fruitless wishes Seek for amongst her mother’s kisses. Since ’tis not to be had at home, She’ll travel to a martyrdom. No home for hers confesses she But where she may a martyr be. She’ll to the Moors, and trade with them For this unvalued diadem. She’ll offer them her dearest breath, With Christ’s name in ’t, in change for death. She’ll bargain with them, and will give Them God; teach them how to live In him; or, if they this deny, For him she’ll teach them how to die. So shall she leave amongst them sown Her Lord’s blood, or at least her own. Farewell then, all the world, adieu! Teresa is no more for you. Farewell, all pleasures, sports, and joys, (Never till now esteemed toys) Farewell, whatever dear may be, Mother’s arms or father’s knee, Farewell house and farewell home, She’s for the Moors, and martyrdom! Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair spouse, Whom thou seek’st with so swift vows, Calls thee back, and bids thee come T’ embrace a milder martyrdom. Blest powers forbid thy tender life Should bleed upon a barbarous knife; Or some base hand have power to rase Thy breast’s chaste cabinet, and uncase A soul kept there so sweet; oh no, Wise Heav’n will never have it so; Thou art Love’s victim, and must die A death more mystical and high; Into Love’s arms thou shalt let fall A still-surviving funeral. He is the dart must make the death Whose stroke shall taste thy hallow’d breath; A dart thrice dipp’d in that rich flame Which writes thy spouse’s radiant name Upon the roof of heav’n, where aye It shines, and with a sovereign ray Beats bright upon the burning faces Of souls, which in that name’s sweet graces Find everlasting smiles. So rare, So spiritual, pure, and fair Must be th’ immortal instrument Upon whose choice point shall be sent A life so lov’d; and that there be Fit executioners for thee, The fair’st and first-born sons of fire, Blest Seraphim, shall leave their quire And turn Love’s soldiers, upon thee To exercise their archery. Oh, how oft shalt thou complain Of a sweet and subtle pain, Of intolerable joys, Of a death in which who dies Loves his death, and dies again, And would forever so be slain, And lives and dies, and knows not why To live, but that he thus may never leave to die. How kindly will thy gentle heart Kiss the sweetly-killing dart! And close in his embraces keep Those delicious wounds, that weep Balsam to heal themselves with. Thus When these thy deaths, so numerous, Shall all at last die into one, And melt thy soul’s sweet mansion Lik@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
