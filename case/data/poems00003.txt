The child I was came to me once, a strange face He said nothing We walked each of us glancing at the other in silence, our steps a strange river running in between We were brought together by good manners and these sheets now flying in the wind then we split, a forest written by earth watered by the seasons’ change. Child who once was, come forth— What brings us together now, and what do we have to say?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Even the wind wants to become a cart pulled by butterflies. I remember madness leaning for the first time on the mind’s pillow. I was talking to my body then and my body was an idea I wrote in red. Red is the sun’s most beautiful throne and all the other colors worship on red rugs. Night is another candle. In every branch, an arm, a message carried in space echoed by the body of the wind. The sun insists on dressing itself in fog when it meets me: Am I being scolded by the light? Oh, my past days— they used to walk in their sleep and I used to lean on them. Love and dreams are two parentheses. Between them I place my body and discover the world. Many times I saw the air fly with two grass feet and the road dance with feet made of air. My wishes are flowers staining my days. I was wounded early, and early I learned that wounds made me. I still follow the child who still walks inside me. Now he stands at a staircase made of light searching for a corner to rest in and to read the face of night again. If the moon were a house, my feet would refuse to touch its doorstep. They are taken by dust carrying me to the air of seasons. I walk, one hand in the air, the other caressing tresses that I imagine. A star is also a pebble in the field of space. He alone who is joined to the horizon can build new roads. A moon, an old man, his seat is night and light is his walking stick. What shall I say to the body I abandoned in the rubble of the house in which I was born? No one can narrate my childhood except those stars that flicker above it and that leave footprints on the evening’s path. My childhood is still being born in the palms of a light whose name I do not know and who names me. Out of that river he made a mirror and asked it about his sorrow. He made rain out of his grief and imitated the clouds. Your childhood is a village. You will never cross its boundaries no matter how far you go. His days are lakes, his memories floating bodies. You who are descending from the mountains of the past, how can you climb them again, and why? Time is a door I cannot open. My magic is worn, my chants asleep. I was born in a village, small and secretive like a womb. I never left it. I love the ocean not the shores.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The cities dissolve, and the earth is a cart loaded with dust Only poetry knows how to pair itself to this space. No road to this house, a siege, and his house is graveyard. From a distance, above his house a perplexed moon dangles from threads of dust. I said: this is the way home, he said: No you can’t pass, and aimed his bullet at me. Very well then, friends and their homes in all of Beirut’s are my companions. Road for blood now— Blood about which a boy talked whispered to his friends: nothing remains in the sky now except holes called “stars.” The city’s voice was too tender, even the winds would not tune its strings— The city’s face beamed like a child arranging his dreams for nightfall bidding the morning to sit beside him on his chair. They found people in bags: a person without a head a person without hands, or tongue a person choked to death and the rest had no shapes and no names. —Are you mad? Please don’t write about these things. A page in a book bombs mirror themselves inside of it prophecies and dust-proverbs mirror themselves inside of it cloisters mirror themselves inside of it, a carpet made of the alphabet disentangles thread by thread falls on the face of the city, slipping out of the needles of memory. A murderer in the city’s air, swimming through its wound— its wound is a fall that trembled to its name—to the hemorrhage of its name and all that surrounds us— houses left their walls behind and I am no longer I. Maybe there will come a time in which you’ll accept to live deaf and mute, maybe they’ll allow you to mumble: death and life resurrection and peace unto you.

Each thing recites its exile . . . a sea of blood—and what do you expect on these mornings except their arteries set to sail into the darkness, into the tidal wave of slaughter? Stay up with her, don’t let up— she sits death in her embrace and turns over her days tattered sheets of paper.

1 We travel upon the Ark, in mud and rain, Our oars promises from God. We live—and the rest of Humanity dies. We travel upon the waves, fastening Our lives to the ropes of corpses filling the skies. But between Heaven and us is an opening, A porthole for a supplication. \"Why, Lord, have you saved us alone From among all the people and creatures? And where are you casting us now? To your other Land, to our First Home? Into the leaves of Death, into the wind of Life? In us, in our arteries, flows a fear of the Sun. We despair of the Light, We despair, Lord, of a tomorrow In which to start Life anew. If only we were not that seedling of Creation, Of Earth and its generations, If only we had remained simple Clay or Ember, Or something in between, Then we would not have to see This World, its Lord, and its Hell, twice over.\" 2 If time started anew, and waters submerged the face of life, and the earth convulsed, and that god rushed to me, beseeching, \"Noah, save the living!\" I would not concern myself with his request. I would travel upon my ark, removing clay and pebbles from the eyes of the dead. I would open the depths of their being to the flood, and whisper in their veins that we have returned from the wilderness, that we have emerged from the cave, that we have changed the sky of years, that we sail without giving in to our fears— that we do not heed the word of that god. Our appointment is with death. Our shores are a familiar and pleasing despair, a gelid sea of iron water that we ford to its very ends, undeterred, heedless of that god and his word, longing for a different, a new, lord.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I amuse myself with my country. I glimpse its future approaching on the eyelashes of an ostrich, I toy with its history and its days, I strike it with stones and thunderbolts. I extinguish its lamps and light its windows, and at the other end of day I inaugurate its history. I am a stranger to all of you. I am from the other end. I live in a country of my own, inflating the sky to see its ashes, and in sleeping and waking I open a bud to live within. Something must be born, so I bore caverns in my skin for lightning and build nests. I must pass like thunder into lips as sad as straw, between stone and autumn, between pore and epidermis, between thigh and thigh. And so I sing: “Form worthy of our demise—advance.” And so I shout and sing: “Who will give us the maternity of the cosmos, who will nourish us with mines?” I advance toward my self, toward ruins. The silence of calamity takes me—I’m too short to gird the earth like a rope, I’m not sharp enough to pierce the face of history and plunge in. You want me to be like you. You boil me in the cauldron of your prayers; you mix me with the broth of armies and the pepper of tyrants, then pitch me like a tent for the wali and hoist my skull like a flag. (My death, Nevertheless I run toward you, I rush rush rush to you.) You live like flagstones, and lamentation is your air. You announce the hedgehog’s abode and sleep on the scarab’s censers—your children are immolations. A distance as great as a mirage divides us. I rouse hyenas in you, I rouse the gods. I sow sedition in you and suckle fever, then teach you to journey without a guide. I am a pole for your latitudes and a walking springtime. I am a convulsion in your throats, a hemorrhage in your words. You advance like leprosy toward me, and I am the one bound to your dirt. Yet nothing unites us, everything divides us—so let me burn alone, let me pass through you like a spear of light. I cannot live with you, I cannot live without you. You are an undulation in my senses, and I cannot escape you. Even so, cry out, “The sea, the sea!” Even so, hang the beads of the sun on your thresholds. Open my memory and study my face beneath its words, learn my alphabet. When you see foam weaving my flesh and stone flowing in my blood, you will see me. I am closed like a tree trunk, present and ungraspable like air. Thus I cannot surrender to you. I was born in the sockets of lilacs, I grew in the orbits of lightning, I live with light and grass. I storm and I clear up, I shine and cloud over, I rain and snow—the hours are my language, and my country is day.The people are sleeping, but if they die they’ll awaken, or so it was said. You are all sleeping, but if you awaken you’ll die, or so it shall be said. You are dirt on my windowpanes, and I must remove you. I am the coming morning and the map that draws itself. Nevertheless, there’s a fever in my bowels that keeps vigil over you. Nevertheless, I await you, In the shell of night by the sea, in the roaring of the depths, in the holes in the robe of the sky, in the jujubes and acacias, in the pines and cedars, in the hearts of the waves, in the salt, I await you. Translated from the Arabic@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I inhabit these fugitive words, I live, my face my face’s lone companion, And my face is my path, In your name, my land That stands tall, enchanted and solitary; In your name, death, my friend. Translated from the Arabic@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Bells on our eyelashes and the death throes of words, and I among fields of speech, a knight on a horse made of dirt. My lungs are my poetry, my eyes a book, and I, under the skin of words, on the beaming banks of foam, a poet who sang and died leaving this singed elegy before the faces of poets, for birds at the edge of sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Our city fled, So I sought its paths in haste And looked around—I saw only horizon, And I perceived that those who flee tomorrow And those who return tomorrow Are a body I tear apart on my page. I could see: the clouds were a throat, The water formed walls of flame. I saw a sticky yellow thread, A thread of the history that clings to me. A hand mulls over my life, ties my days together Time and again, a hand that was heir To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags. I entered the rites of creation In the waters’ womb and the trees’ virginity, I saw trees seducing me, I saw rooms among their branches, Beds and windows resisting me, I saw children and read them My sand, I read them Suras of clouds and verses of stone, I saw them journeying with me, I saw pools of tears and the corpse of rain Gleaming behind them. Our city fled— What am I? A spike of grain Weeping for a lark That died beneath the snow and cold, Died without revealing its messages, Died without writing anyone. I questioned it and saw its corpse Discarded at the end of time, And I cried out, “Silence of the ice, I Am the home of the exiled lark. Its grave is my home, and I’m an exile.” Our city fled, And I saw my feet transform Into a river overflowing with blood, Into ships growing distant, expanding, And I saw my drowned shores seducing ... My waves were wind and pelicans. Our city fled, And refusal is a crushed pearl Whose powder anchors my ships, And refusal is a woodcutter living On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire— And refusal is the distance that disperses me. I see my blood and I see my death Beyond my blood: It speaks to me and pursues me. Our city fled, And I saw how my shroud illumines me, I saw ... If only death would grant me time. Translated from the Arabic@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. The leaves asleep under the wind are the wounds’ ship, and the ages collapsed on top of each other are the wound’s glory, and the trees rising out of our eyelashes are the wound’s lake. The wound is to be found on bridges where the grave lengthens and patience goes on to no end between the shores of our love and death. The wound is a sign, and the wound is a crossing too. 2. To the language choked by tolling bells I offer the voice of the wound. To the stone coming from afar to the dried-up world crumbling to dust to the time ferried on creaky sleighs I light up the fire of the wound. And when history burns inside my clothes and when blue nails grow inside my books, I cry out to the day, “Who are you, who tosses you into my virgin land?” And inside my book and on my virgin land I stare into a pair of eyes made of dust. I hear someone saying, “I am the wound that is born and grows as your history grows.” 3. I named you cloud, wound of the parting dove. I named you book and quill and here I begin the dialogue between me and the ancient tongue in the island of tomes in the archipelago of the ancient fall. And here I teach these words to the wind and the palms, O wound of the parting dove. 4. If I had a harbor in the land of dreams and mirrors, if I had a ship, if I had the remains of a city, if I had a city in the land of children and weeping, I would have written all this down for the wound’s sake, a song like a spear that penetrates trees, stone, and sky, soft like water unbridled, startling like conquest. 5. Rain down on our desert O world adorned with dream and longing. Pour down, and shake us, we, the palms of the wound, tear out branches from trees that love the silence of the wound, that lie awake staring at its pointed eyelashes and soft hands. World adorned with dream and longing world that falls on my brow like the lash of a wound, don’t come close—the wound is closer— don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful. That magic that your eyes had flung on the last kingdoms— the wound has passed over it, passed and did not leave a single sail to tempt toward salvation, did not leave a single island behind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 The leaves sleeping beneath the wind: A vessel for the wound. Time perishing: the glory of the wound. The trees rising among our lashes: A lake for the wound. The wound lies in bridges When the grave lengthens, When patience stretches Between the banks of our love and death. The wound, a gesture, is passing. 2 I give the voice of the wound To the tongue of strangled bells, To stone approaching from afar, To aridity and the arid land, To time borne on a stretcher of ice, I kindle the fire of the wound. When history burns in my garments, When blue nails sprout in my book, When I shout during the day, Who are you? Who’s thrusting you Into my notebooks, Into my virgin earth? In my notebooks, in my virgin earth, I glimpse two eyes of dust And hear someone say, “I am the wound that grows In your narrow history.” 3 I named you cloud, Wound, dove of departure, I named you quill and book. And here I am, starting a dialogue Between myself and the drowned tongue On the isles of exodus, On the archipelago of the ancient fall. And here I am, teaching the dialogue To the wind and palms— Wound, dove of departure. 4 Had I a harbor, had I a vessel In the land of dreams and mirrors, Had I the remains Of a city, had I a city In the land of children and weeping, I would forge them all for the wound Into a spear-like song That pierces trees and stones and sky, A song as supple as water, Unruly and dazed, like conquest. 5 World adorned with dreams and yearning, Rain down on our deserts, Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound, And break two branches off for us From the trees that love the silence of the wound, From the trees with arched lashes and hands That keep vigil over the wound. World adorned with dreams and yearning, World falling in my brow, Drawn like the wound, Come no closer—the wound is closer than you. Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful, And the wound has passed by that enchantment Cast by your eyes In the last kingdoms, Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray, Without leaving it an island.

“In warm sunlight jade engenders smoke”; poetry, like indigo mountain, keeps its distance; the light plays words and figures, stone’s edge edged with air, green haze growing. Amused by butterflies, Chuang Tsu dreaming, the emperor’s heart in spring, thoroughly transformed. Still, in pieces, the words rest so much apart. Risking my life I lean on dangerous railings. When the dream wakes to its own particulars, the strands scattered, loose hair on muslin, broken characters the reeds make, unmake—vague no reason bright again dark— the sidewalk’s fracturing, damp willow twig forked there as well locust seedpods: Autumn, then, and gourd music, the wind—indistinct no-stop break again join. Drifting between narrow bluffs, sharp bends enclose us, deep rain-cuts all around— mountain pass, slant sunlight and snow line, the dream piazza gilded into a high valley; “haze, mist,” Kuo Hsi interrupted, sluice- way wedged into a mountain like a keel; what was said by fire- light, the bandit in the yellow sombrero laughing at the window. Chill surprise of Chinese apples, glitter of the Pacific between buildings—caught in passing, an empty rowboat or Russian sealer riding at anchor, Magellan full sail in dusty curtains, casements groan like taut rigging, bright shore, the heat lines full of spice, breadfruit stretching to our hands; a new nourishment, this mission, or shaded rest— Pitcairn, a century or more. I wanted to make this poem of silk, stretched tight and polished, an ink wash drifting ambiguous mountains, words gathered like momentary details, instances of wind and water among loose foliage, painting au plein air; that is alive and painting a surface of perpetual change, the eye’s return always at odds with memory, however certain; the wind’s warp in the cloth, pressing the brushstroke back full of squalls, relaxing the line out of reach.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It is easily forgotten, year to year, exactly where the plot is, though the place is entirely familiar— a willow tree by a curving roadway sweeping black asphalt with tender leaves; damp grass strewn with flower boxes, canvas chairs, darkskinned old ladies circling in draped black crepe family stones, fingers cramped red at the knuckles, discolored nails, fresh soil for new plants, old rosaries; such fingers kneading the damp earth gently down on new roots, black humus caught in grey hair brushed back, and the single waterfaucet, birdlike upon its grey pipe stem, a stream opening at its foot. We know the stories that are told, by starts and stops, by bent men at strange joy regarding the precise enactments of their own gesturing. And among the women there will be a naming of families, a counting off, an ordering. The morning may be brilliant; the season is one of brilliances—sunlight through the fountained willow behind us, its splayed shadow spreading westward, our shadows westward, irregular across damp grass, the close-set stones. It may be that since our walk there is faltering, moving in careful steps around snow-on-the-mountain, bluebells and zebragrass toward that place between the willow and the waterfaucet, the way is lost, that we have no practiced step there, and walking, our own sway and balance, fails us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I “At odds again,” hands moving out of the shadows. And now, now everything seems definite, discrete, fingers webbed with sunlight the tree lets through, arms still in their own time, circling, catch up, catch hold at the wrists, like cell chains in a watchcrystal completing themselves. Together again. Shoulders, torso, each one of us one, once more. It is hard to imagine minutes just past. II “At odds again,” hands moving against the wind like loose flapping things, washcloths, words long frayed with careless use. You wanted to say it was beginning to bother you, beginning to wish, wondering if thought in broken light could ever touch itself, reassemble itself. The King, our promise, broken, the sword we imagined gone, hovers like leafmold in the light. Say it, then, the stain of things remains. III “At odds again,” elbow cupped into wet leaves. After love, there are moments of clutter, and no amount of practice will teach you to regard them as anything more than what you lean against catching its buried chill. Keep your fancy to yourself; facts do not fade but are momentarily obscured, the work of hands, touch and its out- come, the absence of touch, and distance, the inevitable space between, shapes all our limitations. IV “At odds again,” knee raised slightly, sunlight and shade, patchwork coverlet. Bits and pieces, the story of each thing connected, end to end, this instant extended in every direction. Not a thing in space or things in spaces or spaces between what space seems occupied for this moment, the next. We are not snowstorms of ourselves, spindrift and curl. The whorl of action is a template in time: the casual shifting of leaves, hands moving, the certain flex of possibility.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This is my advice to foreigners: call it simply—the river; never say old muddy or even Missouri, and except when it is necessary ignore the fact that it moves. It is the river, a singular, stationary figure of division. Do not allow the pre-Socratic to enter your mind except when thinking of clear water trout streams in north central Wyoming. The river is a variety of land, a kind of dark sea or great bay, sea of greater ocean. At times I find it good discipline to think of it as a tree rooted in the delta, a snake on its topmost western branch. These hills are not containers; they give no vantage but that looking out is an act of transit. We are not confused, we do not lose our place.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I Geography matters. It is the plan, the arrangement of things that confuses our enemies, the difference between what they expect and what they get; as simple as bobbing for apples becomes difficult, deception is an achievement in ordering the obvious.II Let us make a song for our confusion: Call it “Red Skies over Gary” or “Red Skies in the Sunset” or “Red Skies and the Open Hearth.” Red Skies over Gary, you are my sunset, my only home. Let us make ourselves invisible, not make songs, or even disappear suddenly from the sidewalks of Calumet.III Cobalt and carborundum are refinements of the art. So it’s true, you held the razor in your teeth, or was it pure magic, a miracle of place? One makes for workability, the other for hardness, and chromium bright, the stainless achievement.IV I came from Calumet to Gary, and it was early evening; south of the mills, poppy fields toxic red above the car lots, have a Coke on Texaco ’til the mercury arcs devour us and it is purple night.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

As others or ourselves let’s say—furtive, then, inconsequent and sad— or on the edge of thought, perhaps, or into some predictable meandering, the outward accelerations of water against its shore dissipating into erosions, cuts and counter-cuts, remembered as landscape, the convenient certainties of an abandoned past. Is it tree or treeline or the massing of leaves against the sky or color freed from shadow or something of color deepening against shade, the sensible bluff that heaves above the bluff’s presumed insensible marl? River, again, always enclosed by its own turnings, its own turnings overgrown.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes. Handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. If tulle were life. Handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down. Handsome. Like fire. Handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star. But handsome, too, like a sky that’s an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean’s floor. Handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor. The big question is: where’s the man in a scene like this? Handsome: the man asleep. And the night sky swarms, tropic and wide. Handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat’s paws. Sharp-nailed: they prick. Handsome: the firefly swarms around you. Handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. Like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin. Handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest. Handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a Japanese screen. Handsome motion. Handsome as life and poison. Sun-blood handsome. Bleeding sun.Translated from the French by Robert Archambeau@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Look straight, and don’t tremble, wreckage of my hanged race: a sarabande dancer, Japanese muslin tight on her live-wire hips arrives with the moonlight, fast as the tam-tam drums. She’ll take you to the grand esplanade where the gallows tell your story, tell of your dim bronze halos licked away by a pale man’s greed. Leave your gallows tears behind, the long-drawn vowels of the lost names of flowers, the long-drawn cries of your burden of grain, the long-drawn cries of your burden of seed-pods, and the long-drawn cries of the seed-pods cut and hung. Shipwreck of my race, twisted in the wind-rush, fall from your broken gallows, wrack, wreck, and driftwood, my bloodied race. My bloodied race fearful, scab-dried, sterile, paralyzed, the low-caste wallflowers trembling at a ball for mice— no. Leave your gallows, there, those: the gallows of time-gone-by. Lift your chestnut-dark and heavy limbs, up from out the shipwreck’s carnage, and up through those long blue-green rolling waves. Sing the wind’s songs, and collect what’s needed, drop by shivering drop, in this, your Lenten fasting, in this, your sorcerer’s midnight, under this, the whip. Leave the gallows, the sap of its cut-wood spits on your skin. You’d hang there, yourself in effigy? No. Live sap runs in the driftwood branch. You’ll play, gentle, a light wind in the shimmering green of a dancer’s beaded muslin skirt, and your broken music will move in the foolish grass that still believes in death— leave your gallows-bones there, in the fool’s green shroud . . . Scratch with the rusted nail of melody, because you live, wreckage of my race, the sky will not forget you, nor the graveyard’s earth, fertile and walled. Your blood still dances, a wreckage of joy, joy soured, obstinate joy, wild and unbroken, shipwreck of my race, sarabande.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We got sent home early& no one knew why. I think weare at war! I yelled to my sisterknapsacks ringing against our backs. I copy-catted from Frances who whispered it when the teachersgot silent.

All this tall grass has ruined my gold acrylic nails & I know something’s dead just beyond my window. I grew up with rats running my floorboards & know the smell straining from a body once caught in a trap. In the city what little I have of an ass is always out, a simple wind blow from Marilyn Monroe-ing the street. Here, in all this nature, there is nobody but me & my 5 friends for a week & I promised myself I’d be naked but the first day I found a tick clinging to my arm hair for dear life & decided no way I’m exposing my pussy to the elements. My love for nature is like my love for most things: fickle & theoretical. Too many bugs & I want a divorce. Last week, before I was here my uncle drove me from our city to the suburbs & sang “Project Chick” in the car. When we parked he asked me to take off my shoes & there we walked, silent, barefoot circling the lake, trying to not step in goose shit. He walked in front & I trailed behind both our hands clasped behind our backs. When you were my daughter, those were the happiest days of my life. I wish you would come home. My love for the past is like my love for most things. I only feel it when I’m gone. Best to stay gone so I’m always in love. If I look at something too long it forgets its joy. All the floorboards carry death. My gold nails are fake & chipped. My bare feet skirt the shit.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Where indeed is the Mississippi panorama and the girl that played the piano and kept her hand on her heart as Flanagan drank a quart of moonshine before the eyes of the town's gentlemen? What happened to your locomotive in Winter, Walt, and my ride across the prairies in the trail of the stage-coach, the gold-rush and the Swanee River? Where did they bury Geronimo, heroic chieftain, lonely horseman of this apocalypse who led his tribesmen across deserts of cholla and emerald hills in pursuit of despoilers, half-starved immigrants from a despoiled Europe? What happened to Archibald's soul's harvest on this raw earth of raw hates?

So this is the abscess that hurts the nation— jails, torture, blood and hunger. One day it will burst; it must burst. 3. When I heard you were taken we speculated, those of us at large where you would be in what nightmare will you star? That night I heard the moans wondering whose child could now be lost in the cellars of oppression. Then you emerged, tall, and bloody-eyed. It was the first time I wept. 4. The long nights I dread most the voices from behind the bars the early glow of dawn before the guard's steps wake me up, the desire to leap and stretch and yawn in anticipation of another dark home-coming day only to find that I cannot. riding the car into town, hemmed in between them their guns poking me in the ribs, I never had known that my people wore such sad faces, so sad they were, on New Year's Eve, so very sad.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I look out the bars upon the Castle the crust caked row of age in a corner my friendly spider crouches for the unwary gnats of my days. So much there is we must atone. There are spires of faith in the invisible claws of spiders in the flight and curve of gulls. These know, I swear, the contours of the rolling Saharas and the destitute oceans of our history. We sit, debating the charity of our captors. At night lights come on the shoreline bends into a broad bay near the Castle the sea is gray Yesterday it rained on the eve of my forty-first year and left all my defeats intact Let me lead you into the country It is only as half clansman of the ritual goat that I bring my song to the place of sacrifice here in the pain fields asphalt and smoke of a large hearth I lead my rope is short. I shall soon arrive under the tree. I will stage a hundred fights in honor of our Gods and our beloved leader Here, I could care less for the toiling masses I retreated here before Lent to my own stretch of sea front (I cannot see the damned sea because of old caked walls built by Dutchmen) But the shore falls into a deep gulf there are no cliffs. They found a week-old baby buried in a shallow grave on the front lawn of the fort. I want my grave to be deeper. They are sawing through our firewood Today is cassava day The flutist is silent Perhaps his troops have arrived in Georgia Not to arrive upsets me And for the path that I have trod I have no regrets@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Had death not had me in tears I would have seen the barges on life's stream sail.

Come now, you lucky ones come to the festival of corn and lamb to the finest feast of this land come, now, your lovers have unfurled their cloths their thighs glistening like golden knives ready for the plunging, for the plentiful loving time. To whom shall I turn to what shall I tell my woes ? My kinsmen, the desert tree denied us sustenance long before the drought. To whom shall I turn to whom shall I tell my woes? Some say tell the mother goat she too is my kinswoman elemental sister of your clan But I cannot tell the mother goat for she is not here.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
That night he came home, he came unto me at the cold hour of the night Smelling of corn wine in the dawn dew. He stretched his hand and covered my forehead. There was a moon beam sparking rays in particles. The drummer boys had got themselves a goat. The din was high in the wail of the harvest moon. The flood was up gurgling through the fields Birth waters swimming in floods of new blood. He whispered my name in far echo Sky-wailing into a million sounds across my shores. His voice still bore the sadness of the wanderer To wail and die in a soft lonely echo That echo I heard long ago In the fall of night over my river, In the distant rustle of reeds At growth in the strength of my river. Once upon an evening I heard it Strung clear as the gong of the drummer boys Bright burnished like the glint edge of the paschal knife, ready anxious to cut My cords and enter into my fields. I was still a dream then Carried by the flimsy whiffs Of sweet scents borne aloft on the vision Of my coming flood That will bear me slowly and gently Into his world of smiles and smells. He was not very gentle with me But I did not complain. The thrust was hard and angry, severing the tiny cord Shattering the closed gates of raffia Gathering at its eye the reeds to feed my fishes. My flood had not risen. The canoe carried on the strength Of his man rowed steep down my river into a tumultuous eternity Of green hills and mountains That reeled and rolled to the river shore To clasp and bear me away. Then the floodgates opened for justice to cleanse to purify My evening of awakening In the turbulence of his triumph Into the bright evening of my rebirth. The birth was tedious The pangs were bitter Into the bright evening I rushed Crying I have found him I have found him. He stood there rustling in the wind The desire to go was written large upon his forehead. I was not ready for his coming I was not ready for his loneliness, for his sad solitude against the rustling wind. I was not ready for his entrance Into my fields and shores of my river. The entrance of raffia was closed closed against his lonely solitude. He stood beneath my entrance In his approach I knew the steps he took Like the departing Lazarus Marching toward his grave. I was not ready. The flood was gurgling at his estuary swimming within me birth waters warmed by his coming. He was silent mute against the rushing of the wind to cry and die for his homeland. My flood had not risen then. Across my vastness he marched into the wind his arms folded upon his chest, his eyes searching for the gates that will open his amulets to snatch and wear his talisman of hope. He marched into the wind howling through door posts to catch the boatman at the dawn point. to ferry him across my river. But I was not ready. My hands stretched to cover his in the darkness, to cover his eyes in the agony of his solitude to call him names I knew to put the dressing from my womb upon his cudgel scars, to hold his hand in the clasp of nightfall. He was mute; the wind had stopped rustling He was erect like the totem pole of his household He burned and blazed for an ending Then I was ready. As he pierced my agony with his cry, my river burst into flood. My shores reeled and rolled to the world's end, where they say at the world's end the graves are green.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. Dzogbese Lisa has treated me thus It has led me among the sharps of the forest Returning is not possible And going forward is a great difficulty The affairs of this world are like the chameleon feces Into which I have stepped When I clean it cannot go.1 I am on the world's extreme corner, I am not sitting in the row with the eminent But those who are lucky Sit in the middle and forget I am on the world's extreme corner I can only go beyond and forget. My people, I have been somewhere If I turn here, the rain beats me If I turn there the sun burns me The firewood of this world Is for only those who can take heart That is why not all can gather it. The world is not good for anybody But you are so happy with your fate; Alas! The travelers are back All covered with debt. II. Something has happened to me The things so great that I cannot weep; I have no sons to fire the gun when I die And no daughters to wail when I close my mouth I have wandered on the wilderness The great wilderness men call life The rain has beaten me, And the sharp stumps cut as keen as knives I shall go beyond and rest. I have no kin and no brother, Death has made war upon our house; And Kpeti's great household is no more, Only the broken fence stands; And those who dared not look in his face Have come out as men. How well their pride is with them. Let those gone before take note They have treated their offspring badly. What is the wailing for? Somebody is dead. Agosu himself Alas! A snake has bitten me My right arm is broken, And the tree on which I lean is fallen. Agosi if you go tell them, Tell Nyidevu, Kpeti, and Kove That they have done us evil; Tell them their house is falling And the trees in the fence Have been eaten by termites; That the martels curse them. Ask them why they idle there While we suffer, and eat sand. And the crow and the vulture Hover always above our broken fences And strangers walk over our portion.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The weaver bird built in our house And laid its eggs on our only tree. We did not want to send it away. We watched the building of the nest And supervised the egg-laying. And the weaver returned in the guise of the owner. Preaching salvation to us that owned the house. They say it came from the west Where the storms at sea had felled the gulls And the fishers dried their nets by lantern light. Its sermon is the divination of ourselves And our new horizon limits at its nest. But we cannot join the prayers and answers of the communicants. We look for new homes every day, For new altars we strive to rebuild The old shrines defiled by the weaver's excrement.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It was a time when they were afraid of him. My father, a bare man, a gypsy, a horse with broken knees no one would shoot. Then again, he was like the orange tree, and young women plucked from him sweet fruit. To meet him, you must be in the right place, even his sons and daughter, we wondered where was papa now and what was he doing. He held the mystique of travelers that pass your backyard and disappear into the trees. Then, when you follow, you find nothing, not a stir, not a twig displaced from its bough. And then he would appear one night. Half covered in shadows and half in light, his voice quiet, absorbing our unspoken thoughts. When his hands lay on the table at breakfast, they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home, hands that had not taken us into them and the fingers did not gently rub along our lips. They were hands of a gypsy that filled our home with love and safety, for a moment; with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs, they filled us because of the love in them. Beyond the ordinary love, beyond the coordinated life, beyond the sponging of broken hearts, came the untimely word, the fallen smile, the quiet tear, that made us grow up quick and romantic. Papa gave us something: when we paused from work, my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields, my brother and I running like deer, we would pause, because we had a papa no one could catch, who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank, he bragged about us: he did not say we were smart, nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday. He said we were good. He held us up to the world for it to see, three children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way, who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom, and that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind, to the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring. He said, “Here are my children! Care for them!” And he left again, going somewhere like a child with a warrior’s heart, nothing could stop him. My grandmother would look at him for a long time, and then she would say nothing. She chose to remain silent, praying each night, guiding down like a root in the heart of earth, clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast. And I am the blossom of many nights. A threefold blossom: my sister is as she is, my brother is as he is, and I am as I am. Through sacred ceremony of living, daily living, arose three distinct hopes, three loves, out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Elm branches radiate green heat, blackbirds stiffly strut across fields. Beneath bedroom wood floor, I feel earth— bread in an oven that slowly swells, simmering my Navajo blanket thread-crust as white-feathered and corn-tasseled Corn Dancers rise in a line, follow my calf, vanish in a rumple and surface at my knee-cliff, chanting. Wearing shagged buffalo headgear, Buffalo Dancer chases Deer Woman across Sleeping Leg mountain. Branches of wild rose trees rattle seeds. Deer Woman fades into hills of beige background. Red Bird of my heart thrashes wildly after her. What a stupid man I have been! How good to let imagination go, step over worrisome events, those hacked logs tumbled about in the driveway. Let decisions go! Let them blow like school children’s papers against the fence, rattling in the afternoon wind. This Red Bird of my heart thrashes within the tidy appearance I offer the world, topples what I erect, snares what I set free, dashes what I’ve put together, indulges in things left unfinished, and my world is left, as children know, left as toys after dark in the sandbox.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It is windy today. A wall of wind crashes against, windows clunk against, iron frames as wind swings past broken glass and seethes, like a frightened cat in empty spaces of the cellblock. In the exercise yard we sat huddled in our prison jackets, on our haunches against the fence, and the wind carried our words over the fences, while the vigilant guard on the tower held his cap at the sudden gust. I could see the main tower from where I sat, and the wind in my face gave me the feeling I could grasp the tower like a cornstalk, and snap it from its roots of rock. The wind plays it like a flute, this hollow shoot of rock. The brim girded with barbwire with a guard sitting there also, listening intently to the sounds as clouds cover the sun. I thought of the day I was coming to prison, in the back seat of a police car, hands and ankles chained, the policeman pointed, “See that big water tank? The big silver one out there, sticking up? That’s the prison.” And here I am, I cannot believe it. Sometimes it is such a dream, a dream, where I stand up in the face of the wind, like now, it blows at my jacket, and my eyelids flick a little bit, while I stare disbelieving. . . . The third day of spring, and four years later, I can tell you, how a man can endure, how a man can become so cruel, how he can die or become so cold. I can tell you this, I have seen it every day, every day, and still I am strong enough to love you, love myself and feel good; even as the earth shakes and trembles, and I have not a thing to my name, I feel as if I have everything, everything.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Twenty-eight shotgun pellets crater my thighs, belly and groin. I gently thumb each burnt bead, fingering scabbed stubs with ointment. Could have neutered me, made extinct the volatile, romantic man I am. “He’s dead,” doctor at emergency room could’ve easily told my wife that night. Instead, “Soak him in a bath twice a day. Apply this ointment to the sores. Here’s a month’s supply of pain killers.” I remember the deep guttural groan I gave, when the doctor pressed my groin. Assured I could still make love, morphine drowsed me and in a dull stupor I don’t remember police visiting my bed, or laughing so hard, they scowled for a serious answer. I howled a U.F.O. shot me along the Río Grande, and they cursed and left. In the summer of ’88 I’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf. Still smelling of milk udders, I tied it to the truck rack and drove off. Its hooves teethed at pink roots ’til the whole lush field went bare dirt. A magnificent bull. Glowing wheel of heart breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn. He wrangled his black brawn like a battleshield to challenge the sun, reared thick neck down and sideways, lunged at me with dart and snort, hoof-stamped and nostrilled dirt, ’til I growled him back whipping air with a limber willow branch, poured grain in trough and spread alfalfa. I respected his horns and he the whistling menace of willow. One afternoon my cousin Patricio helped me band the bull’s scrotum, usurp swollen sap in his testicle sack. It withered to a pink wattle and seeded the garden to drive cornstalks to bear hardy, golden horns. Thereafter, he grazed the fenceline, with the tempered lust and peaceful grace of a celibate priest. His bearing now arranged itself elegant as a wild flower sprung over night. ______________ Perfecto shot it. Rasping on a black rope of blood round its neck, it staggered, bouldering convulsions. Blood exploding in bright lash of earthquaked air, it stumble-butted stock trailer fender— second and third shots glowed its death. A quivering shadow of life-flame darkened the air and it sputtered a last drop of blood. I drank long swigs of whiskey and, thinking it was dead, turned to walk away, then it gave a tremendous groan, tremendous groan, a birth-letting groan . . . a moon groan . . . blood spurted out, thick, thick, thick alleys of dead star blood and I turned and said aloud to myself, “That’s the moon’s voice! That’s the moon’s voice!” And the white moon was in the sky, and I looked at the moon for a long time. ______________ I sat on the ground and gulped whiskey, drank the steer’s death still warm in my throat. A beautiful animal! I allowed to be butchered. When it trounced and galloped in the field, its body was a dark, windy cliff edge, and its eyes were doorways of a dream— now it bled a charred scroll of ancient chant in gravel, I would never know, and its blackened logs of blood smoldered dying vowels, I would never hear. My heart’s creak-n-tremble rage milled the steer’s death to red grist, I grieved, I wept drunkenly that no one cared, that humankind betrayed him, that we were all cowards. ______________ Perfecto, Valasquez and the butcher tried to stop me from driving, but now was the time to settle a bad feud with another friend. Redeem the bull’s blood with ours. I drove to Felipe’s house, anger knotted in me tight as the rope tied to the stock trailer steer strained against. I pulled, but could not free myself. (I had a dream night before— I crossed black-iron footbridge, partially collapsed by sea storm. Left-hand railing swept out to sea, I gripped bolt-studded right-hand railing, finger-clutched wire netting sides, carefully descended waist-high water. Waded through slowly and ascended other side— but had lost my sunglasses and wallet, went back, groped bottom, found them and ascended again.) Had to cross that bridge again. Full of significance . . . tonight, deepest part of flooded bridge was danger . . . drowning . . . represented years of my life collapsed and destroyed, water the cleansing element@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
2. Today, running along the river, dead leaves cling to cathedral cottonwood branches, snap in the gusty breeze, give a crisp hiss . . . A wafer thin wind spades up loose dust from the path, and above me, gray leaves clash soft in towering boughs; sounds that might be heard in the silent yard of a monastery like the sandaled steps of monks praying, walking over the swept yard, walking and praying. I run, beneath the winter leaves when right ahead of me at the turn, a plump pheasant white ring neck, gray-black mottled feathers, green phosphorescent head scurries into the dry brush, clashing like rosaries in the sleeves of nuns hurrying to the chapel for evening mass. I jog on. A hawk swoops out and vanishes into the tree tops toward the river. Black crows. Clean swept dirt. Then at the end of the path, turning, heading north, I worry over the love I have for this woman. Then I see seven pairs of mallards burst up in fright at my sudden appearance, and I think how they mate for life and beyond them, poised on the ditch bank, with such regal bearing, a blue heron . . . It’s then I hear a voice, a crystal shining icicle clear voice, cold water but made of sound, tells me, keep my connection to the spirits strong, keep my work spiritual, stay connected to the Creator, and all my worries will be answered in time. Ah, it is a good run . . .@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I am offering this poem to you, since I have nothing else to give. Keep it like a warm coat when winter comes to cover you, or like a pair of thick socks the cold cannot bite through, I love you, I have nothing else to give you, so it is a pot full of yellow corn to warm your belly in winter, it is a scarf for your head, to wear over your hair, to tie up around your face, I love you, Keep it, treasure this as you would if you were lost, needing direction, in the wilderness life becomes when mature; and in the corner of your drawer, tucked away like a cabin or hogan in dense trees, come knocking, and I will answer, give you directions, and let you warm yourself by this fire, rest by this fire, and make you feel safe I love you, It’s all I have to give, and all anyone needs to live, and to go on living inside, when the world outside no longer cares if you live or die; remember, I love you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We are born with dreams in our hearts, looking for better days ahead. At the gates we are given new papers, our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear. We are given shots and doctors ask questions. Then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in. We take tests. Some of us were craftsmen in the old world, good with our hands and proud of our work. Others were good with their heads. They used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world. But most of us didn’t finish high school. The old men who have lived here stare at us, from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated. We pass them as they stand around idle, leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls. Our expectations are high: in the old world, they talked about rehabilitation, about being able to finish school, and learning an extra good trade. But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers, to work in fields for three cents an hour. The administration says this is temporary So we go about our business, blacks with blacks, poor whites with poor whites, chicanos and indians by themselves. The administration says this is right, no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart, like in the old neighborhoods we came from. We came here to get away from false promises, from dictators in our neighborhoods, who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like, swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased. But it’s no different here. It’s all concentrated. The doctors don’t care, our bodies decay, our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value. Our lives don’t get better, we go down quick. My cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines, my T-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying. Just like it used to be in my neighborhood: from all the tenements laundry hung window to window. Across the way Joey is sticking his hands through the bars to hand Felipé a cigarette, men are hollering back and forth cell to cell, saying their sinks don’t work, or somebody downstairs hollers angrily about a toilet overflowing, or that the heaters don’t work. I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry. I look down and see new immigrants coming in, mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders, new haircuts and brogan boots, looking around, each with a dream in their heart, thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives. But in the end, some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was. Some of the younger ones will become gangsters. Some will die and others will go on living without a soul, a future, or a reason to live. Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes, but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools, as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families, so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Winter throws his great white shield on the ground, breaking thin arms of twisting branches, and then howls on the north side of the Black Mesa a deep, throaty laughter. Because of him we have to sell our cattle that rake snow for stubble. Having lived his whole life in a few weeks, slow and pensive he walks away, dragging his silver-stream shield down branches and over the ground, he keeps walking slowly away into death bravely.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It would be neat if with the New Year I could leave my loneliness behind with the old year. My leathery loneliness an old pair of work boots my dog vigorously head-shakes back and forth in its jaws, chews on for hours every day in my front yard— rain, sun, snow, or wind in bare feet, pondering my poem, I’d look out my window and see that dirty pair of boots in the yard. But my happiness depends so much on wearing those boots. At the end of my day while I’m in a chair listening to a Mexican corrido I stare at my boots appreciating: all the wrong roads we’ve taken, all the drug and whiskey houses we’ve visited, and as the Mexican singer wails his pain, I smile at my boots, understanding every note in his voice, and strangers, when they see my boots rocking back and forth on my feet keeping beat to the song, see how my boots are scuffed, tooth-marked, worn-soled. I keep wearing them because they fit so good and I need them, especially when I love so hard, where I go up those boulder strewn trails, where flowers crack rocks in their defiant love for the light.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I could not disengage my world from the rest of humanity. Wind chill factor 11° below. All night wind thrashes barechested trees like a West Texas tent evangelist hissing them on his knees, lisping sinnn . . . sinn . . . sinn . . . All night wind preaches. Old tool shed behind my house fist-cuffs itself to nail-loose tin, horse pasture gates clank their crimes, while neighing black stallions of rain stampede on the patio fleeing gunshots of thunder . . . . Miles south of here, nightscopes pick up human heat that green fuzz helicopter dash panels. A mother whispers, “Sssshhhh mejito, nomás poco más allá. Nomás poco más allá.” Dunes of playing-dead people jack rabbit under strobe lights and cutting whack/blades, “Ssshhh mejito. Sssshhhh.” Child whimpers and staggers in blinding dust and gnashing wind. Those not caught, scratch sand up to sleep against underbellies of roots and stones. Eventually Juanito comes to my door, sick from eating stucco chips— his meals scratched off walls of temporary shelters, and Enrique, who guzzled water at industrial pipes pouring green foam out at the El Paso/Juarez border, and Maria steaming with fever, face dark meteorite, whispers, “Where I come from, Señor Baca, a woman’s womb is a rock, and children born from me, drop like stones, to become dust under death squad’s boots.” And Juanito, “They came at midnight and took my brothers. I have never seen them since. Each judge’s tongue is a bleeding stub of death, and each lawyer’s finger a soft coffin nail.” And Enrique, “You can trust no one. Each crying person’s eye is a damp cellar where thieves and murderers sleep.” They have found refuge here at Black Mesa. The sun passes between our lives, as between two trees, one gray, one green, but side by side.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There are black guards slamming cell gates on black men, And brown guards saying hello to brown men with numbers on their backs, And white guards laughing with white cons, and red guards, few, say nothing to red inmates as they walk by to chow and cells. There you have it, the little antpile . . . convicts marching in straight lines, guards flying on badged wings, permits to sting, to glut themselves at the cost of secluding themselves from their people . . Turning off their minds like watertaps wrapped in gunnysacks that insulate the pipes carrying the pale weak water to their hearts. It gets bad when you see these same guards carrying buckets of blood out of cells, see them puking at the smell, the people, their own people slashing their wrists, hanging themselves with belts from light outlets; it gets bad to see them clean up the mess, carry the blue cold body out under sheets, and then retake their places in guard cages, watching their people maul and mangle themselves, And over this blood-rutted land, the sun shines, the guards talk of horses and guns, go to the store and buy new boots, and the longer they work here the more powerful they become, taking on the presence of some ancient mummy, down in the dungeons of prison, a mummy that will not listen, but has a strange power in this dark world, to be so utterly disgusting in ignorance, and yet so proudly command so many men. . . . And the convicts themselves, at the mummy’s feet, blood-splattered leather, at this one’s feet, they become cobras sucking life out of their brothers, they fight for rings and money and drugs, in this pit of pain their teeth bare fangs, to fight for what morsels they can. . . . And the other convicts, guilty of nothing but their born color, guilty of being innocent, they slowly turn to dust in the nightly winds here, flying in the wind back to their farms and cities. From the gash in their hearts, sand flies up spraying over houses and through trees, look at the sand blow over this deserted place, you are looking at them.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They turn the water off, so I live without water, they build walls higher, so I live without treetops, they paint the windows black, so I live without sunshine, they lock my cage, so I live without going anywhere, they take each last tear I have, I live without tears, they take my heart and rip it open, I live without heart, they take my life and crush it, so I live without a future, they say I am beastly and fiendish, so I have no friends, they stop up each hope, so I have no passage out of hell, they give me pain, so I live with pain, they give me hate, so I live with my hate, they have changed me, and I am not the same man, they give me no shower, so I live with my smell, they separate me from my brothers, so I live without brothers, who understands me when I say this is beautiful? who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms? I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand, I cannot make the heavens open or the earth tremble, I can live with myself, and I am amazed at myself, my love, my beauty, I am taken by my failures, astounded by my fears, I am stubborn and childish, in the midst of this wreckage of life they incurred, I practice being myself, and I have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me, they were goaded out from under rocks in my heart when the walls were built higher, when the water was turned off and the windows painted black. I followed these signs like an old tracker and followed the tracks deep into myself, followed the blood-spotted path, deeper into dangerous regions, and found so many parts of myself, who taught me water is not everything, and gave me new eyes to see through walls, and when they spoke, sunlight came out of their mouths, and I was laughing at me with them, we laughed like children and made pacts to always be loyal, who understands me when I say this is beautiful?CORRECTION: the last line of the first stanza was corrected to read \"who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?\", and the first line of the second stanza was corrected to read \"I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand,\" on November 15, 2010.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Yesterday, the sunshine made the air glow pushing me like a sixteen-year-old to toss my shirt off, and run along the river shore, splashing in the water, wading out to the reeds, my heart an ancient Yaki drum and I believed, more than believed, the air beneath trees was female blue dancers I approached, and there in the dry leaves, in the crisp twigs, I turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air, sunlight, in shrub-weed skirts. I knew the dance that would please the Gods, I knew the dance that would make the river water smile glistening ever silvering, I knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors. Yeah, I wanted to write you a poem woman for two days, and today it was gray and snowy and overcast, about how I startled the mallards from their shallow refuge beneath the Russian olive trees and how the male purposely came close to me diverting my attention to it its female love went the other way risking its life, that's what I saw, the male fly before the hunter's rifles, circle in sights of hunters and take the shots, the roaring rifle blast after blast and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion. That's how I miss you, that's how I wanted to write you a poem since we left you one way me another way. I was the male taking with me the hunters that would harm you risking my heart so yours wouldn't be hurt, fronting myself as possible prey so you could escape, that kind of poem I am writing you now. Circling as hunters aim down on me while you rise, rise, rise into the blue sky and meet me over in the next fields. I wanted to write you a poem for two days now to tell you how happy I was, seeing a white crane arc between banks in the irrigation ditch with furious efforts, its big wings flapping like an awkward nine-year-old kid much taller than the others his age with size twelve sneakers flapping down the basketball court. But once the white crane found its balance, its wings their grace, it glided more perfectly than a ballet dancer's leap across air, all of its feathers ballet dancer's toes, all of its feathers delicate dancers all of its feathers, in motion made me believe in myself, but more, when it rose, swooped up, the line of ascent up made me think of the curve of your spine, how I traced my finger down your spine when you slept, your spine is the ascent of the crane toward the sunshine, and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips became air, a blue cold artic air you glided up in your song of winter love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

8/1 From here groomed fields and clumps of trees, a silo of corrugated tin and a white barn blur. Unseasonable cool days, high, blue, a few clouds like ripped pillows as if this were a lip of the North Sea and I could look out and imagine Denmark. But I’m in my office three floors up. 8/3 In Armenian there’s a word—garod—rhymes with “maud.” The beautiful ones are not faithful and the faithful ones are not beautiful— a student said that about some Pavese translations, here in my office. Should I tell you what garod means? 8/5 What’s happening in Spitak and Sarajevo and the West Bank is splayed like the cortex of a silicon chip in the fuzzy air. Maria, the physician from Armenia, was 25 & had one plastic arm and one real arm. I met her in East Hampton on the deck of a house on the dunes. After the earthquake she had no husband, no parents, and only one child. “I’m in a good mood today,” she said, “let’s talk about something else.” I poured her an Amstel Light. 8/10 The coolness intrudes— month of wind-sprints and retching for the coach. It comes back like nerve ends after surgery. Along a country road cicadas rattling. Chicory and sweet pea intruding on the ripe barley. I picked up some seed packs from a junk shop on Rt. 20, a tomato blazed in red ink/ 1926, Fredonia, N.Y. 8/11 What’s between us? The red ink of the tomato? How does an image stay? Or is it always aftermath? The way deep black reflected the most light in Talbot’s first calotypes. But garod: tongue of a snake, meaning exile, longing for home. Thomas Wedgwood got images by getting sunlight to pass through things onto paper brushed with silver nitrate: wings of a dragonfly, the spine of an oak leaf— fugitive photograms. But he couldn’t stop the sun until it turned the paper black. Stop the light before it goes too far? Or is desire what garod means? Longing for a native place. 8/17 Maria said she was learning how to connect nerve endings in the hand so hands and arms would work again. There were so many in Armenia without working hands and arms. At the end of each dendrite is a blurred line like the horizon I’m squinting. Image of the other: light-arrested; not the image of ourselves. 8/21 After digging scallions one day Dickinson defined freedom: Captivity’s consciousness, so’s liberty. Maybe garod is about the longing for the native place between two selves. 8/22 I love the brute force of silence in Roger Fenton’sSebastopol from Cathcart’s Hill, 1855. The Crimean inner war. The artlessness of silver is like my tongue in your wet space, or like the news photos that bring us the pressure of disaster. Beloved topography,garod then must mean yearning. Is that how we loved under the rattling Nippon porcelain, in the light calotyped by the fire escape? 8/25 garod: the grain chute that spills into a dark barn which is endless, like the self when it’s out of reach. Are we so lonely that a constellation could blacken and fill up that same barn, and that be me or you? But still we’re piss and oats and stock in there. We’re like civet, who wouldn’t love it. 8/31 the new glass-plate pictures: transparent as air, Szarkowski wrote like windowsthe fragmentary, scruffy, particularity of real living behind them—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
All summer the patio drifted in and out of light the color of margarine; days were blue, not always sky blue. At night the word Algeria circulated among the grown-ups. A patient of my father had whooping cough, the words drifted into summer blue. The evenings spun into stadium lights. Kennedy’s hair blew across the screen. Castro was just a sofa. I saw James Meredith’s face through a spread of leaves on the evening news. The fridge sweat with orangeade, the trees whooped some nights in rain— a kid down the street kept coughing into his mitt. Static sounds from Comiskey and Fenway came though the vinyl, the plastic, the pillow— So when it left Stallard’s hand, when Roger Maris’s arms whipped the bat and the bullet-arc carried into the chasm the disaffections at 344 ft. near the bullpen fence under the green girder holding up the voices rising into the façade and over the river where a Baptist choir on Lenox Ave. was sending up a variation of Sweet Chariot into the traffic on the FDR that was jammed at the Triboro where a derrick was broken and the cables of its arms picked up the star-blast of voices coming over the Stadium façade spilling down the black next-game sign into the vector of a tilted Coke bottle on a billboard at the edge of the river where a cloud of pigeons rose over Roosevelt Island. It was evening by the time the cars unjammed and the green of the outfield unfroze and the white arc had faded into skyline before fall came full of boys throwing themselves onto the turf with inexplicable desire for the thing promised. The going. Then gone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The tide’s a Bach cantata. The beach is the swollen neck of Isaac. The tide’s a lamentation of white opals. The beach is free. The Coke machine rusted out. Here is everything you’ll never need: hemp-cords, curry-combs, jade and musk, a porcelain cup blown into the desert— stockings that walked to Syria in 1915. On the rocks some ewes and rams graze in the outer dark. The manes of the shoreline undo your hair. A sapphire ring is fingerless. The weed and algae are floating like a bed, and the bloodless gulls— whose breaths would stink of all of us if we could kiss them on the beaks— are gnawing on the dead.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. A canvas with less turpentine, more hard edges, less bleeding, that was good for beauty, Frankenthaler in Art News in the dining car crammed with parkas and laptops micro-waved cellophane, plastic plates and canvas bags, and the valley under fog as the cows disappeared and when the green came back into view I could see the SUVs floating on the Thruway, the cows oblivious to the revved engines of trucks. The river glistened all the way to Albany, and I could see flags on Baptist churches and resurrection trailers, “God Bless America” on pick-ups— “United We Stand” laminated to billboards as the fog settled then lifted, and when I woke a flag the size of a football field hung from the gray tower of the GW, where the tractor-trailers jammed beneath its hem as something sifted down on the silver-plated Hudson. And then the lights went out. 2. The faces on 7th Avenue blurred in the chaos of vendors and liberty scarves, freedom ties, glowing plastic torches, dollars and polyester— and inside Macy’s I was hit by cool air as “Stars and Stripes Forever” floated down from women's fashions into the quiet aisles of Aramis and silk scarves. I wanted to buy the Frankenthaler, a modest, early print, minimal, monochromatic; surface and perspective in dialogue; on 24th off 10th—the gallery still smelled like wood and plaster— but I didn't stop, and when the train reached the Stock Exchange the Yom Kippur streets were quiet, and the bronze statue of Washington was camouflaged by national guard. I was walking my old mail route now like a drunk knocking into people, almost hit by a cab until the roped-off streets cut me at the arm. At Broadway and Liberty the fences wound around the bursts of dust rising over the cranes and bulldozers, over the punched-out windows— I stared through a piece of rusted grid that stood like a gate to the crystal river. I was sweating in my sweatshirt now, the hood filling with soot, as I watched with others drinking Cokes and eating their pizza of disbelief. Zero began with the Sumerians who made circles with hollow reeds in wet clay and baked them for posterity. At Broadway and Liberty. At 20 floors charred and standing. At miasma people weeping. Anna's Nail Salon, Daikichi Sushi, the vacant shops, stripped clean in the graffiti of dust-coated windows. Something blasted from a boom box in a music store, something, in the ineffable clips of light, disappeared over the river.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 You said anyone could walk in with a pack of explosives as we passed through the crowds of tourists and school kids — under the glass-grid ceiling lit with sun. I was saying: She’s our earth, our body, our sex, as we drifted down the halls of statues and colonnades and hunks of facades of Greek temples until we found room 22, “The Hellenistic World,” where a bronze face in a glass box on the wall stared back at us.Head from a bronze cult statue of Anahita, a local goddess in the guise of Aphrodite (200–100 BC) the text hung there in space — Found in Satala in NE Asia Minor (Armenia Minor) a left hand holding drapery was found with the head // and out of some bad Comedy Central joke, my iPhone buzzed with a flash news update about ISIS or ISIL, or whatever they called themselves that week — Temple of Baalshamin at Palmyra — blown up — the phrase re-circled — blown up — 2 and my head was back in the white van with the TV crew in ’09 winding through the buttes and roadside gullies of the Syrian desert, to the Armenian memorial in Der Zor, before we went to Palmyra where I sat under 50-foot Corinthian columns — the corners chipped by wind and sand in late May when it hit 110 at noon and the sun melted the plastic rim of my cell phone — as our driver appeared out of nowhere with stacks of zaatar bread and Diet Cokes — we found some shade under a portico as the visionary pillars disappeared into blue sky. 3 Outside students were buzzing through the gates of UCL and the brown brick of Bloomsbury was lit up with sun after rain — inside the wunderkammer of Hans Sloane and the collectors who hauled their stuff from the Middle East — (What is the Middle East? my Turkish publisher asked an audience at NYU — Istanbul, Jerusalem, Mumbai, Srinagar?) you kept asking: What is year zero to us? Didn’t our war destroy some temples and museums? I called the curator on the phone at the info desk to leave my complaint on the message machine about the signage: “Satala wasn’t Armenia Minor/NE Asia Minor — it was central Armenia /Anatolia — make correction.” 4 What questions were we asking staring at the misinformation on the wall and the beautiful Armenian head of Anahit? Why was I back in Der Zor at the chapel digging Armenian bones out of the baked ground — scratching the marrow and dried mildew? 5 In the age of throat-slitting on Twitter the imperial shock and awe of burning Tigris — the lynching of Saddam on the internet, vanishing tomb of Jonah — which fetishized objects ... whose museum? 6 I’m gazing at the head of Anahit — Armenian goddess of fertility and love — (no more local than the Brooklyn Bridge) staring at the green and red paint still speckled on her bronze head. I love her serpentine upper lip, her eyes of black space — I stare into the screw hole in her neck the two curlicues of hair on her forehead her august throat; her dense acanthine hair.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The day comes in strips of yellow glass over trees. When I tell you the day is a poem I’m only talking to you and only the sky is listening. The sky is listening; the sky is as hopeful as I am walking into the pomegranate seeds of the wind that whips up the seawall. If you want the poem to take on everything, walk into a hackberry tree, then walk out beyond the seawall. I’m not far from a room where Van Gogh was a patient—his head on a pillow hearing the mistral careen off the seawall, hearing the fauvist leaves pelt the sarcophagi. Here and now the air of the tepidarium kissed my jaw and pigeons ghosting in the blue loved me for a second, before the wind broke branches and guttered into the river. What questions can I ask you? How will the sky answer the wind? The dawn isn’t heartbreaking. The world isn’t full of love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 In the rheumatic heat of July, when Public Enemy blared on the blasters in a time when arbitrage and foreign policy were bureaus of each other, I made a wrong turn off Broadway and wound up at St. John the Divine where I sat in the hot dark until the traffic died. * And a voice comes over some columns to the breeze of the Golden Horn over the cypress groves and flowing bougainvillea where the bright blue weather and the old seawalls come together, where crates of cardamom and musk are piled and the cattle hang in blood above the brass, where the grain boats stink and red pleasure barges drift where Jason sailed for his fleece— a voice comes out of the dead water. In great Sophia light pours in rosy bars on the porphyry and the green marble till the air blooms, and a chrysalis of lit crosses makes circles in the air. Light falls through the lunettes like arrows of gold that could’ve sneaked up the Virgin’s dress. Had the Holy Ghost flitted in it would’ve been lost in the glare and the kiss of peace Justinian blew from the ambo. * Incantations flutter and rhyme in the apse like wings in a cloud of incense thinning on the gold-leafed vaults where the tongue’s vibration lingers in the upper air, and rises and rises as if the dome could open to a half-hemisphere of heaven where in the translucent glitter of the Kingdom the Saints are poised in gracious robes with their thousand-year-frozen faces— the one truth glued on the grout of their lips. 2 I sit with the incense of memory, and a bath of dark pours from the vaults above the pew Outside, boutiques of money collide with the street fires in Harlem, whole skyscrapers are levitated by arbitrage, and the only inside takeover I can negotiate is myself in this pew with my herringbone jacket which I should chuck in the Salvation Army bin down the block, so I could join the line of choir- boys in their last innocent ritual as they stand before the mounted sermon sign “he shall bring forth judgment unto truth” (Isaiah 42:3). The Puritans because they believed God’s altar needs not their polish lifted the boulder of truth higher than the glittering face of the Nazarene once leaded in glass. For the spirit they swallowed stones and shattered all the panes. But beneath the lavender arch of a Canon Table in an old Gospel I once tasted the consubstantial dewdrop in the faded color of a peacock’s wing. So while a stone sinks to the bottom of my river, a peacock’s wing floats by the shore. Who tells it like it is: Isaiah or Procopius? 3 I started walking backward down the aisle when I heard and thought I saw in the strange fenestration of that light— a voice, first incoherent, and then sharp as if it were in my earThere is no reign that executes justice and judgment; is that why you whine? “But Primo Levi’s image of a man— a face that haunts every nation on the earth— this, this!”Don’t soak lentils in your mouth. “Be serious; what’s left to praise?”The fig tree drops rocks in the morning and the fig tree drops figs in the morning.It’s your new yard, am I right? New house, 2 kids, and all that. “Yup.”When a Santa Ana blows fire down the coast do you run to meet it in a leisure suit or with a silicon chip?Does a squirrel stash nuts of self-pity up its ass?What are verses for? And the raisin-light dribbling in the clerestory faded, and it was cold as I backed down the aisle: “We’ll talk more when you’re off duty.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I drove through the narrow Gods— privet and cholesterol, or Irish creamery butter as the waiter called it, as it shaved another day off my life. There was no salt and antimony, just lumpy roads through Meath and Leitrim. The sky was a show of flashing mirrors as day broke on Rosses. Tide out and weed like cow pies on the shore. The punt down and the EEC on the horizon, as I read in the guidebook about pilgrims climbing St. Patrick’s barefoot every summer. Out of the fog a man in Wranglers and spurred boots, clean-shaven, a cigarette in hand, waved me down.“Scrum faced house at the end of the bay.” “Hop in,” I said. “You lookin’ for where John Wayne made The Quiet Man?” “No.” “American?” “Yep.” “Don’t look it. You Jewish too?” “No.” “I-talian?” “No.” The fog was lifting off the fern-scalded mountains across the bay, and the sheep marked red and blue looked like sweaters.“Grace O’Malley hijacked British ships up here, and the Choctaws sent $500 during the famine. Not a fuckin’ penny from the U.S.” We passed the rusted hulls of fishing boats and the scaffolding of floating mussel beds.“The Downing Street Accord is lots of shit; Adams’ a frog on an oil slick. When Lord Haw Haw broadcast for the Nazis from right here, do ya think he was a traitor or a patriot? … to us, I mean?” I couldn’t bring myself to tell him I was on sabbatical and looking for a place to write.“They’ll turn the bog to Marks & Spencer anyway.” “I’m looking for Knock-Na-Rae.”“Maeve’s mountain? Two hours from here in the other direction.” I dropped him at the scrum house half roofless and cracked, where the sky seemed lower than the rocks and the hills the color of red sheep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 After the Reformation had settled the loamy soil and the lettuce-green fields of dollars, the clouds drifted away, and light fell everywhere. Even the snow bloomed and New Hampshire was a big peony. A red barn shone on a hill with scattered hemlocks and white pines and the gates of all the picket fences were big shut-eyes. 2 Sometime after the Civil War, the bronze wing of liberty took off like the ribboning smoke of a Frick factory, and all the citizens in towns from Stockbridge to Willamette ran wild on the 4th. The sound of piccolos lingered, and the shiny nickel of the sun stood still before it fizzed in the windshield of a Ford. By then you were a lawyer. 3 Charles Ives was a bandmaster in Danbury, and you didn’t give him the time of day. He played shortstop on the piano. He never made it to his tonic home base, and his half-tones were like oak leaves slapping clapboard. 4 How Miltonic are we anyway? 5 In that red glass of the imagination, in that tingling crystal of the chandelier where light freezes in its own prism and the apogee of the green lawns of New Haven wane like Persian carpets in twilight, there you saw a pitcher, perhaps from Delft, next to a plate of mangoes. 6 But still, history is a boomerang, and the aborigines never threw one without a shield. 7 Beyond the porches of Key West, beyond the bougainvillea, your speech skipped on tepid waves, was lapped and lapped by lovers and friends, by scholars who loved romantic nights of the sun. But the fruits and pendants, the colorful cloth, the dry palm fronds, and the fake voodoo wood Cortes brought back as souvenirs were just souvenirs. And the shacks and the cane and the hacked plantain were tableaux, and who saw them from your dark shore? 8 The Protestant dinner plate is a segregated place, where the steak hardens, and the peas sit frightened in their corner while mashed potatoes ossify. Some gin and ice cream, and the terror of loneliness goes for a while. 9 As they say in the sunny climes, un abrazo.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My mother is a fish and the sky is low and orange, and the long grass rises in the still air. The mud is black and worms turn their cold segments at my feet. I used to walk with an old lady. It seemed far from water and the ground sank. Weeds were higher than my head. Slugs slept in the mud. My mother is a fish and the sky swallows my head. A fine rain comes and softens the ferns. In March before the crocus and the lily, eggs bunch in the shoal of green jelly. Crabs glide through them. A kingfisher is dead on a rock. My mother is an eel winding a light around the rock. Even without a moon the black glows. * The sun grows like an egg over the bridge, the first birds are silver and swoop down for my mother. When the lady came we jumped— She took us to find worms we could squeeze in our hands. I went with my father to the dark water. I went with a bucket of mud. When we doubled the worm on the hook and it coiled, I could hear how a bass could thud. I grabbed it with a wet hand, and watched its eye go black as I dropped it in a metal bucket. Hack it along the gill and throw the head to the gulls. My mother is a fish and flutters in my bucket. The sky is a fleck of stones on the night water. Turns my arms silver. The wind calls my father out to where bigger birds call and caw and spin, where my father goes and leaves me with the mud and gulls on the patchy water.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. Balak in Hebrew (devastator)—King of Moab son of Zippor (sparrow), meaning he who was always running away into the desert as the Israelites were fast on his back. Angry, humiliated, full of vinegar and sap, looking for the diviner. 2. Balak (in Turkish, eccentric variant) meaning baby buffalo— something forging Anatolian rivers, Armenian fossil of the word, flushed downstream. 3. Who drowned wading in the reeds of the Ararat plain? There the sky is cochineal. There the chapel windows open to raw umber and twisted goats. There the obsidian glistens and the hawks eat out your eyes. 4. If you thought of diaspora, you were thinking of emerald stones. If you thought of the marshes of snails and magenta bugs, you were wading in the reeds. Ur: like rolling a good Merlot on the palate till it runnels up the nose. Ah: breath of the unknown. Tu: also, everything, self and side of mountain. The soul sweats. The blue knifes the canyon. In a cave, a man lived on herbs and water; the sky’s grisaille was a visitation; the leaves were out of toot sin Jants; the angels were alpha and omega— 5. This road goes north— no need to ask where you are, sentimental pop songs are stuck in the CD shuffle there’s a valley, a river, a smoking something— if you ask what color is the sky can anyone say—cloudless, clotted, open?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the hermetic almost dark under the fluorescent dizz I found her broken nerves, smoke coming off the dashes, the caps like jolts to the neck, the pried-open spaces between vowels where the teeth bit off twine and the tongue was raw then cool with ice. The air of the stockroom after lunch was the marbleized silence of the small blank pages she stitched into privacy. Air of paper and faint glue bond, carbon, graph, yellow pads, in the stockroom I could read alone— the confetti of money dissolved on the blank wall. After work, I slid the numbered poems on blue mimeo into my playbook, and felt the open field the zig-zagging past cornerbacks, the white lines skewed to heaven. Excuse my mood—unbridled, chemical, her scrawled messages smooth to the mind, excuse my absence, again and yes, then, too— the cold stone of the Palisades was there after we split— alone naked in the Hudson, the water greasing me in the tepid, chemical mix, before I returned to the cement of 9W in my father’s Skylark the night black and soundless within.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. What were we watching on the tube under mildewed ceilings in Eastlands? A Kenyan guy shaking a rattle made from a can while another guy in the band was talking to the queen about making sound out of anything? The queen smiled. The Jubilee receiving line filed through. 2. We shimmied past tin shacks selling wigs and bananas, coke and goat lungs; the tine of a kalimba kissed my face. My face kissed the blue plastic of a soda bottle sliding down a hill of glass. I paid the gang leaders for protection and we walked into the hills of airplane garbage, black and blue plastic bags glowing in the sun spray over the heads of the marabou stalking the mounds with their knife-blade beaks. 3. Stevie Wonder and Elton John moved through the Jubilee line. Prince Charles thanked God for the weather as the camera cut to fireworks spewing over Hyde Park and then to an image of Nairobi and the Slum Drummers picking metal out of the collages of garbage. 4. My jeans were charred from the tin-can fires, and the grilling pig guts when some men looked up from scraps of wire— and you went back and forth with them in Swahili before they offered us some sizzling fat, before we thanked them with our coy smiles and moved on with Michael who took us down a maze of alleyways where tin shacks were floating on polymers and nitrogen and a dozen pigs from nowhere snouted the garbage. 5. You were saying “Dad”—when a marabou-hacked bag shot some shit on our shoes—“Dad, kinship roles are always changing”— when a woman asked us for a few shillings and salt for her soup. Salt? Did I hear her right? Or was it Swahili for something else? And through the sooty wind of charcoal fires and creaking rusty tin you were saying, “Hannah Arendt called Swahilia degraded language of former slave holders.” In the soot of my head—I was listening— and Michael was asking for more shillings for the gang guys who were “a little fucked up,” he said, “but needed help”— and when I turned around the heads of chickens were twitching, the feathers fluttering down on oozing sludge; “Arendt called it a nineteenth century kind of no language,” you were saying, “spoken”—as we were jolted by a marabou eating a shoe—“spoken—by the Arab ivory and slave caravans.” 6. Out of bottles, cans, pipes, mangled wire—the Slum Drummers twisted and hacked, joined and seamed their heaven into the black plastic ghost of a mashed pot. Pure tones blew from the vibrato holes like wind through Makadara where the breath of God flew through sewage pipes. I heard in a tubophone the resurrection of ten men rising out of coal and pig snouts into the blue Kenyan sky where a marabou swallowed a purse—and a woman’s conga was parting at the seams above boiling soup cans. 7. Down a slope of stinking plastic you kept on about Arendt— “a hybrid mixture of Bantu with enormous Arab borrowings” I could say poa poa sawa sawa karibu. We could make a kalimba out of a smashed pot and pour beans into a can and shake it for the queen. Yesterday in the soundless savannah the wildebeests and zebras seemed to float through the green-gold grass toward Tanzania. We could hear a lion breathe; we could hear wind through tusks. 8. On TV the guys were grinning into metal go-go drums; hammering twisted sewage pipes and cut wire like sailors from Mombasa— harder nailed than da Gama’s voyage down the Arab trade coast— 9. So, where are we—in a slum of no language? Walking through steam shovels of light, breaking over mounds of metal as if the sky were just blue plastic? Isn’t English just a compost heap of devouring grammar, joined, hacked, bruised words, rotting on themselves? I keep following you, daughter of scrutiny, into plastic fields of carrion between sight and site, vision not visionary, pig guts on the grill, trying to keep balance between streams of sewage and the sky, as you keep hacking, Sophia, at the de-centered, the burning text, anthropology’s shakedown. A marabou just knifed the arm of a woman picking bottles out of plastic bags. A rooster crows fr@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Paolo It was not Virgil you read (though I asked you to), but the Peruvian, part Indian, part cousin of Lorca whose words were spiky points, wafts of privet, week-old cod. When you breathed them at me nothing in the outer world ceased its turbulent grim direction. You breathed on my unhooked eyes and uncovered me. Above the roof a windfucker smacked the air, and wind kept eating the island rocks.Francesca We ate along the riverside at sundown. The clear green juice dripped from my mouth. We didn’t fuck missionary on clean sheets. I lost my head between your legs. My nose spreading like honey. A whiff of narcissus swept across us. I ate the flowers whole, tried to outfox Satan with my tongue. I felt as if I shimmied up your legs to find this point on the Jersey cliffs. The sun was God’s eye. I plugged my ears so I wouldn’t hear your crappy verse, then tore into your pants like a scared cat. The Chrysler Building was a pin. I tasted you five hundred feet as the Hudson pulled me under.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I left Eli Zabar the cut-out star on the window was whirling in the animation of the rich and hungry hunched over tables for a $30 sandwich and a Diet Coke. It was raining and the blurred glass of the galleries was the gold leaf of the Carrig Rhone frames— Childe Hassam’s dabs of Connecticut trees the diaphanous blue on the fleshy rocks, the melting opal of the shoals. Inside the Whitney the rain trailed down my face; and I found myself in a quiet corner staring at the pink face of Marilyn Monroe. I could still smell the smoldering high-tech plastic as it burned the air. In the whiteness of her teeth, in the almost aahh of her mouth and the half-drugged eyes under the lids of teal shadow, the air kept singeing my nose. Against the pale walls Marilyn’s face dissolved like a stretched mesh and litho ink where plain form is a place of no desire like the empty mirror of the Hudson at dawn. In the fissures of her make-up, the planes of color led back and back behind her teeth longing— to the deception by the Falls on her honeymoon (with Joseph Cotton in Niagara)—where we found her clothed and alarmed, and later desperate for the affirmation, of a President’s limp dick and the crisp sheets the same color of these walls—as my t shirt dries to my skin and the faintest scent of ground zero sifts down on the walls whiter than the wingtip vortices of melting in the morning light.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I saw his face on a wall at a party in a parlor looking out at the Hudson, at a fundraiser for the winter soldiers over blocks of cheese and baguettes, I had just come from some grainy footage of Dien Bien Phu in a hot black room, where the scratched print showed the hills undulating, bodies and parachutes disappearing in jungle grass. Between decadence and the alien Mao was propped in yellow and rouge with lipstick and eye shadow, a real queen—part décor, part radical something the American lexicon hadn’t filled in yet. From the aerial cameras Haiphong Harbor was liquid light. In liquid light, I saw my draft card float like a giant litho over the highway at 79th the letters popped—selective service system— and morphed into gray rain— anyone could have done it— singed, blurred, laminated— and the bartender poured me another unidentified drink. In the scratched cellulose nitrite, parachutes kept drifting down on the hedges of the Laotian border. On the wall Mao was the punctum in rouge and yellow and smear. Didn’t every myth signify confusion? Confucius, Charlie Chan, Chiang Kai-shek? (An American vision of a place.) The guy behind me in class asked, “Where is this place?” Hanoi was glittering flecks on the nightly news, and the teacher answered, “Every snake of land is someone’s history.” We didn’t know what we didn’t know about the backyard furnaces, the tens of millions. Even if Mao swallowed Darwin and Adam Smith swimming the Yangtze—here on the Upper West in late spring, he was wallpaper, the most recognizable face in the world. There seemed no point in breaking through the mask— I was glued to the colors for a while, until the next war let us out of Asia until the sun went down on the wall.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The trees shook with the throb of steel. What did we do to be so red, white, and blue? We were inexorable like the dialectic unraveling from Hanoi to the Jacksonian grass. We were the inebriates of vitamin C and cocaine, the daughters of the gray flannel suit. And when the shaman spread his yellow robe like the sun he was all teeth and amp and what were we?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Life! I know not what thou art, But know that thou and I must part; And when, or how, or where we met, I own to me’s a secret yet. But this I know, when thou art fled, Where’er they lay these limbs, this head, No clod so valueless shall be, As all that then remains of me. O whither, whither dost thou fly, Where bend unseen thy trackless course, And in this strange divorce, Ah tell where I must seek this compound I? To the vast ocean of empyreal flame, From whence thy essence came, Dost thou thy flight pursue, when freed From matter’s base encumbering weed? Or dost thou, hid from sight, Wait, like some spell-bound knight, Through blank oblivious years th’ appointed hour, To break thy trance and reassume thy power? Yet canst thou without thought or feeling be? O say what art thou, when no more thou ’rt thee? Life! we’ve been long together, Through pleasant and through cloudy weather; ’Tis hard to part when friends are dear; Perhaps ’t will cost a sigh, a tear; Then steal away, give little warning, Choose thine own time; Say not Good night, but in some brighter clime Bid me Good morning.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Yes, injured Woman! rise, assert thy right! Woman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest; O born to rule in partial Law's despite, Resume thy native empire o'er the breast! Go forth arrayed in panoply divine; That angel pureness which admits no stain; Go, bid proud Man his boasted rule resign, And kiss the golden sceptre of thy reign. Go, gird thyself with grace; collect thy store Of bright artillery glancing from afar; Soft melting tones thy thundering cannon's roar, Blushes and fears thy magazine of war. Thy rights are empire: urge no meaner claim,— Felt, not defined, and if debated, lost; Like sacred mysteries, which withheld from fame, Shunning discussion, are revered the most. Try all that wit and art suggest to bend Of thy imperial foe the stubborn knee; Make treacherous Man thy subject, not thy friend; Thou mayst command, but never canst be free. Awe the licentious, and restrain the rude; Soften the sullen, clear the cloudy brow: Be, more than princes' gifts, thy favours sued;— She hazards all, who will the least allow. But hope not, courted idol of mankind, On this proud eminence secure to stay; Subduing and subdued, thou soon shalt find Thy coldness soften, and thy pride give way. Then, then, abandon each ambitious thought, Conquest or rule thy heart shall feebly move, In Nature's school, by her soft maxims taught, That separate rights are lost in mutual love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Germ of new life, whose powers expanding slow For many a moon their full perfection wait,— Haste, precious pledge of happy love, to go Auspicious borne through life's mysterious gate. What powers lie folded in thy curious frame,— Senses from objects locked, and mind from thought! How little canst thou guess thy lofty claim To grasp at all the worlds the Almighty wrought! And see, the genial season's warmth to share, Fresh younglings shoot, and opening roses glow! Swarms of new life exulting fill the air,— Haste, infant bud of being, haste to blow! For thee the nurse prepares her lulling songs, The eager matrons count the lingering day; But far the most thy anxious parent longs On thy soft cheek a mother's kiss to lay. She only asks to lay her burden down, That her glad arms that burden may resume; And nature's sharpest pangs her wishes crown, That free thee living from thy living tomb. She longs to fold to her maternal breast Part of herself, yet to herself unknown; To see and to salute the stranger guest, Fed with her life through many a tedious moon. Come, reap thy rich inheritance of love! Bask in the fondness of a Mother's eye! Nor wit nor eloquence her heart shall move Like the first accents of thy feeble cry. Haste, little captive, burst thy prison doors! Launch on the living world, and spring to light! Nature for thee displays her various stores, Opens her thousand inlets of delight. If charmed verse or muttered prayers had power, With favouring spells to speed thee on thy way, Anxious I'd bid my beads each passing hour, Till thy wished smile thy mother's pangs o'erpay.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Midway the hill of science, after steep And rugged paths that tire the unpractised feet, A grove extends; in tangled mazes wrought, And filled with strange enchantment: dubious shapes Flit through dim glades, and lure the eager foot Of youthful ardour to eternal chase. Dreams hang on every leaf: unearthly forms Glide through the gloom; and mystic visions swim Before the cheated sense. Athwart the mists, Far into vacant space, huge shadows stretch And seem realities; while things of life, Obvious to sight and touch, all glowing round, Fade to the hue of shadows. Scruples here, With filmy net, most like the autumnal webs Of floating gossamer, arrest the foot Of generous enterprise; and palsy hope And fair ambition with the chilling touch Of sickly hesitation and blank fear. Nor seldom Indolence these lawns among Fixes her turf-built seat; and wears the garb Of deep philosophy, and museful sits In dreamy twilight of the vacant mind, Soothed by the whispering shade; for soothing soft The shades; and vistas lengthening into air, With moonbeam rainbows tinted. Here each mind Of finer mould, acute and delicate, In its high progress to eternal truth Rests for a space, in fairy bowers entranced; And loves the softened light and tender gloom; And, pampered with most unsubstantial food, Looks down indignant on the grosser world, And matter’s cumbrous shapings. Youth beloved Of science — of the Muse beloved, — not here, Not in the maze of metaphysic lore, Build thou thy place of resting! Lightly tread The dangerous ground, on noble aims intent; And be this Circe of the studious cell Enjoyed, but still subservient. Active scenes Shall soon with healthful spirit brace thy mind; And fair exertion, for bright fame sustained, For friends, for country, chase each spleen-fed fog That blots the wide creation — Now heaven conduct thee with a parent’s love!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Child of distress, who meet’st the bitter scorn Of fellow-men to happier prospects born, Doomed Art and Nature’s various stores to see Flow in full cups of joy—and not for thee; Who seest the rich, to heaven and fate resigned, Bear thy afflictions with a patient mind; Whose bursting heart disdains unjust control, Who feel’st oppression’s iron in thy soul, Who dragg’st the load of faint and feeble years, Whose bread is anguish, and whose water tears; Bear, bear thy wrongs—fulfill thy destined hour, Bend thy meek neck beneath the foot of Power; But when thou feel’st the great deliverer nigh, And thy freed spirit mounting seeks the sky, Let no vain fears thy parting hour molest, No whispered terrors shake thy quiet breast: Think not their threats can work thy future woe, Nor deem the Lord above like lords below;— Safe in the bosom of that love repose By whom the sun gives light, the ocean flows; Prepare to meet a Father undismayed, Nor fear the God whom priests and kings have made.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The Muses are turned gossips; they have lost The buskined step, and clear high-sounding phrase, Language of gods. Come, then, domestic Muse, In slip-shod measure loosely prattling on, Of farm or orchard, pleasant curds and cream, Or droning flies, or shoes lost in the mire By little whimpering boy, with rueful face — Come, Muse, and sing the dreaded washing day. Ye who beneath the yoke of wedlock bend, With bowed soul, full well ye ken the day Which week, smooth sliding after week, brings on Too soon; for to that day nor peace belongs, Nor comfort; ere the first grey streak of dawn, The red-armed washers come and chase repose. Nor pleasant smile, nor quaint device of mirth, Ere visited that day; the very cat, From the wet kitchen scared, and reeking hearth, Visits the parlour, an unwonted guest. The silent breakfast meal is soon despatched, Uninterrupted, save by anxious looks Cast at the louring, if sky should lour. From that last evil, oh preserve us, heavens! For should the skies pour down, adieu to all Remains of quiet; then expect to hear Of sad disasters — dirt and gravel stains Hard to efface, and loaded lines at once Snapped short, and linen-horse by dog thrown down, And all the petty miseries of life. Saints have been calm while stretched upon the rack, And Montezuma smiled on burning coals; But never yet did housewife notable Greet with a smile a rainy washing day. But grant the welkin fair, require not thou Who callest thyself, perchance, the master there, Or study swept, or nicely dusted coat, Or usual ’tendence; ask not, indiscreet, Thy stockings mended, though the yawning rents Gape wide as Erebus; nor hope to find Some snug recess impervious. Shouldst thou try The ’customed garden walks, thine eye shall rue The budding fragrance of thy tender shrubs, Myrtle or rose, all crushed beneath the weight Of coarse-checked apron, with impatient hand Twitched off when showers impend; or crossing lines Shall mar thy musings, as the wet cold sheet Flaps in thy face abrupt. Woe to the friend Whose evil stars have urged him forth to claim On such a dav the hospitable rites; Looks blank at best, and stinted courtesy Shall he receive; vainly he feeds his hopes With dinner of roast chicken, savoury pie, Or tart or pudding; pudding he nor tart That day shall eat; nor, though the husband try — Mending what can’t be helped — to kindle mirth From cheer deficient, shall his consort’s brow Clear up propitious; the unlucky guest In silence dines, and early slinks away. I well remember, when a child, the awe This day struck into me; for then the maids, I scarce knew why, looked cross, and drove me from them; Nor soft caress could I obtain, nor hope Usual indulgencies; jelly or creams, Relic of costly suppers, and set by For me their petted one; or buttered toast, When butter was forbid; or thrilling tale Of ghost, or witch, or murder. So I went And sheltered me beside the parlour fire; There my dear grandmother, eldest of forms, Tended the little ones, and watched from harm; Anxiously fond, though oft her spectacles With elfin cunning hid, and oft the pins Drawn from her ravelled stocking, might have soured One less indulgent. At intervals my mother’s voice was heard, Urging dispatch; briskly the work went on, All hands employed to wash, to rinse, to wring, Or fold, and starch, and clap, and iron, and plait. Then would I sit me down, and ponder much Why washings were; sometimes through hollow hole Of pipe amused we blew, and sent aloft The floating bubbles; little dreaming then To see, Montgolfier, thy silken ball Ride buoyant through the clouds, so near approach The sports of children and the toils of men. Earth, air, and sky, and ocean hath its bubbles, And verse is one of them — this most of all.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Rotting in the wet gray air the railroad depot stands deserted under still green trees. In the fields cold begins an end. There were other too-long-postponed departures. They left, finally, because of well water gone rank, the smell of fungus, the chill of rain in chimneys. The spot is abandoned even in memory. They knew, locking doors upon empty houses, to leave without regret is to lose title to one home forever.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The country lies flat, expressionless as the face of a stranger. Not one hillock shelters a buried bone. The city: a scene thin as a theater backdrop, where no doors open, no streets extend beyond the view from the corner. Only the railroad embankment is high, shaggy with grass. Only the freight, knuckling a red sun under its wheels, drags familiar box-car shapes down long perspectives of childhood meals and all crossings at sunset. With a look deep as the continent, with the casual greeting of those who will meet again, it bestrides the viaduct. Its span is the span of trestles above mountain gorges, its roar the echo of streams still wearing away stone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Ink-black, but moving independently across the black and white parquet of print, the ant cancels the author out.

Out of a high meadow where flowers bloom above cloud, come down; pursue me with reasons for smiling without malice. Bring mimic pride like that of the seedling fir, surprise in the perfect leg-stems and queries unstirred by recognition or fear pooled in the deep eyes. Come down by regions where rocks lift through the hot haze of pain; down landscapes darkened, crossed by the rift of death-shock; place print of a neat hoof on trampled ground where not one leaf or root remains unbitten; but come down always, accompany me to the morass of the decaying mind. There we’ll share one rotted stump between us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What’s geography? What difference what mountain it is? In the intimacy of this altitude its discolored snowfields overhang half the world. On a knife rim edge-up into whirlpools of sky, feet are no anchor. Gravity sucks at the mind spinning the blood-weighted body head downward. The mountain that had become a known profile on the day’s horizon is a gesture of earth swinging us above falling spaces, above a map of the world. Disturber of the unseen, provoker of the gusts in which we bend struggling against destruction gaping eastward. The wind fails. The breath held. The illusion of death. The resisting shoulder unopposed lurches west in innocent still air, as steep, as deep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
At supper time an ondine’s narrow feet made dark tracks on the hearth. Like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire’s heat, but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold. The sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor. She sat there with a silvered cedar knot for a low stool; and I sat opposite, my lips and eyelids hot in the heat of the fire. Piling on dry bark, seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress, I felt uneasiness as though firm sand had shifted under my feet in the wash of a wave. I brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat, but sat there crying her cold tears, her blue lips quivering with cold and grief. She blamed me for a thief, saying that I had burned a piece of wood the tide washed up. And I said, No, the tide had washed it out again; and even so, a piece of sodden wood was not so rare as polished agate stones or ambergris. She stood and wrung her hair so that the water made a sudden splash on the round rug by the door. I saw her go across the little footbridge to the beach. After, I threw the knot on the hot coals. It fell apart and burned with a white flash, a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke. I beat it out with a poker in the soft ash. Now I am frightened on the shore at night, and all the phosphorescent swells that rise come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes with a cold firelight in them; and crooked driftwood writhes in dry sand when I pass. Should she return and bring her sisters with her, the withdrawing tide would leave a long pool in my bed. There would be nothing more of me this side the melting foamline of the latest wave.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Wheel of sorrow, centerless. Voices, sad without cause, slope upward, expiring on grave summits. Mournfulness of muddy playgrounds, raw smell of rubbers and wrapped lunches when little girls stand in a circle singing of windows and of lovers. Hearing them, no one could tell why they sing sadly, but there is in their voices the pathos of all handed-down garments hanging loosely on small bodies.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
After reading Ash Wednesday she looked once at the baked beans and fled. Luncheonless, poor girl, she observed a kind of poetic Lent— and I had thought I liked poetry better than she did. I do. But to me its most endearing quality is its unsuitableness; and, conversely, the chief wonder in heaven (whither I also am sometimes transported) is the kind of baggage I bring with me. Surely there is no more exquisite jointure in the anatomy of life than that at which poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal and Mrs. B. sits murmuring of avocados.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The seas has made a wall for its defence of falling water. Those whose impertinence leads them to its moving ledges it rejects. Those who surrender it will with the next wave drag under. Sand is the beginning and the end of our dominion. The way to the dunes is easy. The shelving sand is stiffened in the rain and loosened again in the sun’s fingers. Children, lustful of the glistening hours drink and are insatiate. Wind under the eyelids, confusion walling their ears, their bodies glow in the cold wash of the beach. And after, they walk with rigid feet the planked street of the town. They miss the slipping texture of the sand and a sand pillow under the hollow instep. They are unmoved by fears that breed in darkening kitchens at sundown following storm, and they rebel against cold waiting in the wind and rain for the late sail. Did you, as I, condemn the coastal fog and long for islands seen from a sail’s shadow? The dunes lie more passive to the wind than water is. This, then, the country of our choice. It is infertile, narrow, prone under a dome of choral sound: water breaking upon water. Litter of bare logs in the drift— the sea has had its sharp word with them. Wild roses, wild strawberries cover the dune shoulder It is a naked restless garden that descends from the crouched pine to shellfish caught in flat reflecting sands. We lose the childish avarice of horizons. The sea ends against another shore. The cracked ribs of a wreck project from the washed beach. Under the shell-encrusted timbers dripping brine plucks at the silence of slant chambers opening seaward. What moving keel remembers such things as here are buried under sand? The transitory ponds and smooth bar slide easily under the advancing tide, emerging with the moon’s turning. Clear lagoons behind the shattered hulk, thin movements of sea grass on the dune rim bending against cloud, these things are oursI Submissive to the sea and wind, resistful of all else, sand is the beginning and the end of our dominion.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The snake, alphabet of one glide, swims with its keepsake head, periscoping, and then we lose it in the pond grass, lashed among the bottom-feeders. Pocketing goggles, my gaze tends pineward, to the driest sky in twenty years (also passing, rain predicted), a month of sun days. In Fairbanks, all-night baseball and a picnic breakfast Alaskan-style. Someone’s driving south, to Anchorage, in that luscious uplift that here will linger long enough for us to get a sunburn, to get down, to get stung, to get the hang of happiness and get going. Get the picture? I do, but just for the moment, which is why I want it monumental, equestrian, astride, however I can get it. What’s passing is June, another; peony’s scent; postcards from the lower forty-eight. The frog I trod sprang back intact, all its receptors set on July.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We are walking our very public attraction through eighteenth-century Philadelphia. I am simultaneously butch girlfriend and suburban child on a school trip, Independence Hall, 1775, home to the Second Continental Congress. Although she is wearing her leather jacket, although we have made love for the first time in a hotel room on Rittenhouse Square, I am preparing my teenage escape from Philadelphia, from Elfreth’s Alley, the oldest continuously occupied residential street in the nation, from Carpenters’ Hall, from Congress Hall, from Graff House where the young Thomas Jefferson lived, summer of 1776. In my starched shirt and waistcoat, in my leggings and buckled shoes, in postmodern drag, as a young eighteenth-century statesman, I am seventeen and tired of fighting for freedom and the rights of men. I am already dreaming of Boston— city of women, demonstrations, and revolution on a grand and personal scale. Then the maître d’ is pulling out our chairs for brunch, we have the surprised look of people who have been kissing and now find themselves dressed and dining in a Locust Street townhouse turned café, who do not know one another very well, who continue with optimism to pursue relationship. Eternity may simply be our mortal default mechanism set on hope despite all evidence. In this mood, I roll up my shirtsleeves and she touches my elbow. I refuse the seedy view from the hotel window. I picture instead their silver inkstands, the hoopskirt factory on Arch Street, the Wireworks, their eighteenth-century herb gardens, their nineteenth-century row houses restored with period door knockers. Step outside. We have been deeded the largest landscaped space within a city anywhere in the world. In Fairmount Park, on horseback, among the ancient ginkgoes, oaks, persimmons, and magnolias, we are seventeen and imperishable, cutting classes May of our senior year. And I am happy as the young Tom Jefferson, unbuttoning my collar, imagining his power, considering my healthy body, how I might use it in the service of the country of my pleasure.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I knew the hard winter of sapphires set within gold claws, amber and pipestone strung on gut, fringed pouches stuffed with hash.Separate, separate, I urged her that summer of Woodstock, when I lied to get the car and draped my love beads around the neck of someone else’s sister. In a hayloft in Ohio my friend lifted three bales to show me a litter of week-old kittens, each pair of eyes infected with a slimy mucus. Their pupils swam in opaque opal membranes and they would have gone blind if she had not pulled an eyedropper of antibiotics from her jacket, doing what the mother cat could not do, what the owners would not trouble themselves to do, doing what a sister or friend might do if she took the time to attend the wayward, opalescent unhappiness in this world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Seeing my friend’s son in his broad-brimmed hat and suspenders, I think of the Quakers who lectured us on nonviolent social action every week when I was a child. In the classrooms we listened to those who would not take up arms, who objected, who had accepted alternative service in distant work camps and showed slides of hospitals they helped to build. On Wednesdays, in Meeting for Worship, when someone rose to speak, all the energy in the room flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell what she had seen on her brief encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable, a riddle, a kindness. The fall that we were seventeen, we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path from the Meetinghouse, while maple and elm leaves sailed around our shoulders like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside. Despite the war in Vietnam, I felt safer than I ever would again. Perhaps those aged, protective trees had cast a spell on us, or maybe the nonviolent Quaker God had set up a kingdom right there— suburban Philadelphia. Looking back, I see how good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic room for Latin, descended to the gym for sports, where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds of righteous behavior. We prepared to leave for college, armed with the language of the American Friends and the memories of Thanksgiving dinners we’d cooked for the unfortunates: borrowing our parents’ cars to drive downtown to the drop-off point, racing back to play our last field hockey match. Grim center forwards shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs’ knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I’ve expanded like the swollen door in summer to fit my own dimension. Your loneliness is a letter I read and put away, a daily reminder in the cry of the magpie that I am still capable of inflicting pain at this distance. Like a painting, our talk is dense with description, half-truths, landscapes, phrases layered with a patina over time. When she came into my life I didn’t hesitate. Or is that only how it seems now, looking back? Or is that only how you accuse me, looking back? Long ago, this desert was an inland sea. In the mountains you can still find shells. It’s these strange divagations I’ve come to love: midday sun on pink escarpments; dusk on gray sandstone; toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot climb to Acoma Pueblo, where the spirit of the dead hovers about its earthly home four days, before the prayer sticks drive it away. Today all good Jews collect their crimes like old clothes to be washed and given to the poor. I remember how my father held his father around the shoulders as they walked to the old synagogue in Philadelphia. \"We're almost there, Pop,\" he said. \"A few more blocks.\" I want to tell you that we, too, are almost there, for someone has mapped this autumn field with meaning, and any day October brooding in me, will open to reveal our names—inscribed or absent — among the dry thistles and spent weeds.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Dark mornings shown thy mask made well thy visage and voice rolling over and hearing some perfect sweetness that one broad soul poured forth again in happy countenance and ancient word my city cold for me, my nature lost come back sallow soft and colorless thy dreams repent as: The whole family each with his own “Now, sweet child, we must kiss winter goodbye, and so too your furs.” She clutched the puppy to her breast. “Not little Bobby, father.” “Yes, my darling, little Bobby as well.” And this, as she ought, was how Gretel remembered summer – a constant giving up of things and people.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It was as if her love had become a big eye or some historical logic or a religious particle lodged in the brain. In the most costly services of a great society one may find the allure of a benign intelligence. I have hoped, since I was a child, to be surrounded by a group of articulate characters who might with gracious friendship provide some essential entertainment as Aaron’s which was a cane and then a snake and then a cane again great clouds of smoke from the forest Itsy bugs amarch my naked legs in my beard, to burn as one might with one’s eyes I learned, but can no longer remember with what dignity another’s care imbues one.

Lying in bed I think about you, your ugly empty airless apartment and your eyes. It’s noon, and tired I look into the rest of the awake day incapable of even awe, just a presence of particle and wave, just that closed and deliberate human observance. Your thin fingers and the dissolution of all ability. Lay open now to only me that white body, and I will, as the awkward butterfly, land quietly upon you. A grace and staying. A sight and ease. A spell entangled. A span. I am inside you. And so both projected, we are now part of a garden, that is part of a landscape, that is part of a world that no one believes in.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I let my body down slow which is what they say to do, like a whale with its breathing and floating in the ocean. Yesterday was the half moon and today was basically the half moon too. A glacier’s blue and water in the middle of a lake is blue. I only had one day during which I could get myself out into the middle of it and I did, kudos to me. And to the resilient goose who never feels cold And to the talky crow who has so many friends And to the inspiring stealthy ducks who fly together in clips above water. It’s a silly betrayal of my own thoughts to invent or remember, so maybe I’ll just close with these tender lines of Henry David Thoreau: “An oak tree in Hubbard’s Passage stands absolutely motionless and dark against the sky.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The welcome Sun from sea Freake is returned, And cheereth with his beams the naked earth, Which gains with his coming her apparel And had his absence six long months mourned. Out of her fragrant sides she sends to greet him The rashed primrose and the violet; While she the fields and meadows doth beset With flowers, and hangs the trees with pearl to meet him. Amid this hope and joy she doth forget, To kill the hemlock which doth grow too fast, And chill the adder making too much haste, With his black sons revived with the heat; Till summer comes with diverse colours clad, Much like my Epigrams both good and bad. ﻿@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Easy it were the earth to portray out, Or to draw forth the heavens’ purest frame, Whose restless course, by order whirls about Of change and place, and still remains the same. But how shall man’s, or manner’s, form appear, Which while I write, do change from what they were? ﻿@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I met a courtier riding on the plain, Well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed; I sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain My lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed: He saw my case, and then of courtesy Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in, Because I did desire his company: But he corvetting way of me did win. What should I do, who was besteaded so? His horse stood still faster than mine could go. ﻿@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Methinks 'tis pretty sport to hear a child, Rocking a word in mouth yet undefiled. The tender racket rudely plays the sound, Which weakly banded cannot back rebound, And the soft air the softer roof does kiss, With a sweet dying and a pretty miss, Which hears no answer yet from the white rank Of teeth, not risen from their coral bank.

But now you see it, she’s supposed to call. Surely neither will converse, they merely tell, succumbing to a disorderly shelf life like Tampax in June. Salute the budding terminus where the East Side was. Can there be a way to redefine the tense behind its jaunts, the pubescent imagery a hand calls forth as, rippling, it is thrust into the brine? The phantom tugboat slips along in depths past Garbo’s awnings and the united glaze which wilts, harnessing dim signatories in the windows’ sarong. Do things go further in need as I could? Or are they immune? How else have I been taught to guess and then been told to know, because matter equals good? A silken light masks the entrance to the market proofs of time.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I It’s odd to have a separate month. It escapes the year, it is not only cold, it is warm and loving like a death grip on a willing knee.

Bunny Berigan first recorded “I Can’t Get Started” with a small group that included Joe Bushkin, Cozy Cole and Artie Shaw in 1936. Earlier that same year, the song, written by Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke, and rendered as a duet patter number by Bob Hope and Eve Arden, made its debut on Broadway in The Ziegfeld Follies. By 1937, when Berigan re-recorded it in a big-band setting, “I Can’t” had become his signature song, even though, within a few months, Billie Holiday would record her astonishing version backed by Lester Young and the rest of the Basie Orchestra. Lovers for a time, Lee Wiley and Berigan began appearing together on Wiley’s fifteen-minute CBS radio spot, Saturday Night Swing Club, in 1936. Berigan died from alcoholism-related causes on June 2, 1942. Although “I Can’t Get Started” is perfectly suited to Wiley’s deep phrasing and succinct vibrato, she recorded the ballad only once, informally, in 1945, during a Town Hall performance date. The Spanish Civil War started in 1936 and ended in 1939 with Generalissimo Francisco Franco’s forces entering Madrid. “I’ve settled revolutions in Spain” goes Gershwin’s lyric, just as odd.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Dustin Hoffman’s bookcase hanging by one hinge in air of Eleventh Street, dawn 1969. Telephone solicitation for a ballet school in need of “serious floors.” The thought of someone flat on his back on the carpet, tossing and giggling. If it hurts don’t do it.

It was just so much.& then, the yesterdays just become yesterday, A story that you tell yourself about not dying, Another thing, when it’s mentioned, to downplay. That’s what me and that woman did, trying To love each other. What kind of fool am I, Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies. 5 Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies: I walk these streets, ruined by what I’d hide. Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine. I barely see my daughters at all these days.Out here caught up, lost in an old cliché. But tell me, what won’t these felonies betray? Did a stretch in prison to be released to a cell.Returned to a freedom penned by Orwell. My noon temptation is now the Metro’s third rail. In my wallet, I carry around my daguerreotype,A mugshot, no smiles, my name a tithe. What must I pay for being this stereotype? The pistols I carried into the night, my anchor; The crimes that unraveled me, my banner. 6 The crimes that unraveled me—my banner.Only a fool confesses to owning that fact. Honesty a sinkhole; the truth doomed to subtract Everything but prayer, turn my breath into failure.Whiskey after prison made me crave amber, Brown washing my glass until I’m smacked.The murder of crows on my arm an artifactOf freedom: what outlasts even the jailor.Alas, there is no baptism for me tonight. No water to drown all these memories.The rooms in my head keep secrets that indict Me still; my chorus of unspoken larcenies.You carry that knowledge into your twilight, & live without regret for your guilty pleas. 7 & live wi@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Some people say prison is the country where life is cheaper than anywhere else;you wouldn’t think that watching us take leave,our caravan three deep and black againstthe wine-dark asphalt, and two of threeare nothing but escorts: four uniformedshotguns (off safety) leading and flankingour coffle, all intent to keep us here,and not wherever shackles and cuffs runin this dead of morning, less than fifty miles from where Nat Turner dug a hole and layfor weeks. Virginia, something noose-like thenand some say still, except for all the shit we did to land in this here hull and cul-de-sac. The guard, he say “die, but don’t run”when one of us begin to cough his lung up in sleep. And this is ruin. Damn these chains,this awkward dance I do with this van. Two-step,my body swaying back and forth, my head a pendulum that’s rocked by the wild riffsof the dudes I’m riding with: them white folks knowyou ain’t god body, what you commune wineand bread? Where you from son? Red lines?To what Onion? My eyes two caskets though,so the voices are sheets of sound. Our van as darkinside as out, and all the bodies blackand voices black too and I tell my godif you have ears for this one, know I want no part of it, no Onions and no tears.I tell no one, and cry my dirge. This place,the cracked and scratching vinyl seats, the loudloud talk of murder this and blanket feararound the rest, is where I’m most at home,but it’s beyond where prayers reach, a pointsomething like purgatory. I lean backand drift in sleep as someone says, his voiceall hoarse and jacked, all broken songbird-likeall revolutions end with a L-note.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The link between us all is tragedy, & these so many years later, I am thinking about him, all of twenty & gay & more free than any of us might ever be, & this is one way of telling the story, another one is aphorism or threat: blood on my knife or blood on my dick, which is to say that surviving that young & beautiful and willing to walk every day as if wearing sequins meant believing that there is always something worth risking doom. There is no reason for me to think of him now, especially with the football player’s hanging body eclipsing another prison cell, except, maybe the kid whose name I can’t remember but walk I can, had mastered something the dead man’s singing legs could never, how not to abandon the body’s weight, & how to make the body expand, to balloon, to keep becoming, until even the danger could not swallow you. One day I watched him, full of fear for my own fragility & wondered how he dared own so much of himself, openly. For all I know every minute in those cells was safe for the kid whose name I cannot recall. But how can a man ever be safe like that, when you are so beautiful the straight ones believe it & want to talk to you as if they love you and want you to dare them to believe some things in this world must be far too lovely to ever be broken.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
in the backseat of my car are my own sons, still not yet Tamir’s age, already having heard me warn them against playing with toy pistols, though my rhetoric is always about what I don’t like, not what I fear, because sometimes I think of Tamir Rice & shed tears, the weeping all another insignificance, all another way to avoid saying what should be said: the Second Amendment is a ruthless one, the pomp & constitutional circumstance that says my arms should be heavy with the weight of a pistol when forced to confront death like this: a child, a hidden toy gun, an officer that fires before his heart beats twice. My two young sons play in the backseat while the video of Tamir dying plays in my head, & for everything I do know, the thing I don’t say is that this should not be the brick and mortar of poetry, the moment when a black father drives his black sons to school & the thing in the air is the death of a black boy that the father cannot mention, because to mention the death is to invite discussion of taboo: if you touch my sons the crimson that touches the concrete must belong, at some point, to you, the police officer who justifies the echo of the fired pistol; taboo: the thing that says that justice is a killer’s body mangled and disrupted by bullets because his mind would not accept the narrative of your child’s dignity, of his right to life, of his humanity, and the crystalline brilliance you saw when your boys first breathed; the narrative must invite more than the children bleeding on crisp fall days; & this is why I hate it all, the people around me, the black people who march, the white people who cheer, the other brown people, Latinos & Asians & all the colors of humanity that we erase in this American dance around death, as we are not permitted to articulate the reasons we might yearn to see a man die; there is so much that has to disappear for my mind not to abandon sanity: Tamir for instance, everything about him, even as his face, really and truly reminds me of my own, in the last photo I took before heading off to a cell, disappears, and all I have stomach for is blood, and there is a part of me that wishes that it would go away, the memories, & that I could abandon all talk of making it right& justice. But my mind is no sieve & sanity is no elixir & I am bound to be haunted by the strength that lets Tamir’s father, mother, kinfolk resist the temptation to turn everything they see into a grave & make home the series of cells that so many of my brothers already call their tomb.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I love sweets,— heaven would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream ... But my true self is thin, all profile and effortless gestures, the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul. —My doctors tell me I must give up this ideal; but I WILL NOT ... cannot. Only to my husband I’m not simply a “case.” But he is a fool. He married meat, and thought it was a wife. . . . Why am I a girl? I ask my doctors, and they tell me they don’t know, that it is just “given.” But it has such implications—; and sometimes, I even feel like a girl. . . . Now, at the beginning of Ellen’s thirty-second year, her physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs only 92 pounds. . . . About five years ago, I was in a restaurant, eating alone with a book. I was not married, and often did that ... —I’d turn down dinner invitations, so I could eat alone; I’d allow myself two pieces of bread, with butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of vanilla ice cream, at the end,— sitting there alone with a book, both in the book and out of it, waited on, idly watching people,— when an attractive young man and woman, both elegantly dressed, sat next to me. She was beautiful—; with sharp, clear features, a good bone structure—; if she took her make-up off in front of you, rubbing cold cream again and again across her skin, she still would be beautiful— more beautiful. And he,— I couldn’t remember when I had seen a man so attractive. I didn’t know why. He was almost a male version of her,— I had the sudden, mad notion that I wanted to be his lover ... —Were they married? were they lovers? They didn’t wear wedding rings. Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed politics. They didn’t touch ... —How could I discover? Then, when the first course arrived, I noticed the way each held his fork out for the other to taste what he had ordered ... They did this again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent smiles, for each course, more than once for each dish—; much too much for just friends ... —Their behavior somehow sickened me; the way each gladly put the food the other had offered into his mouth—; I knew what they were. I knew they slept together. An immense depression came over me ... —I knew I could never with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth: happily myself put food into another’s mouth—; I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal. . . . Even as a child, I saw that the “natural” process of aging is for one’s middle to thicken— one’s skin to blotch; as happened to my mother. And her mother. I loathed “Nature.” At twelve, pancakes became the most terrible thought there is ... I shall defeat “Nature.” In the hospital, when they weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt. . . . January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost realism.... Her physical examination showed nothing striking. Salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides. January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary, writes that art is the “mutual permeation” of the “world of the body” and the “world of the spirit” Says that her own poems are “hospital poems ... weak—without skill or perseverance; only managing to beat their wings softly.” February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-erotic component strikingly evident. February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by this. Has entirely,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I To see my father lying in pink velvet, a rosary twined around his hands, rouged, lipsticked, his skin marble ... My mother said, “He looks the way he did thirty years ago, the day we got married,— I’m glad I went; I was afraid: now I can remember him like that ...” Ruth, your last girlfriend, who wouldn’t sleep with you or marry, because you wanted her to pay half the expenses, and “His drinking almost drove me crazy—” Ruth once saw you staring into a mirror, in your ubiquitous kerchief and cowboy hat, say: “Why can’t I look like a cowboy?” You left a bag of money; and were the unhappiest man I have ever known well.II It’s in many ways a relief to have you dead. I have more money. Bakersfield is easier: life isn’t so nude, now that I no longer have to face you each evening: mother is progressing beautifully in therapy, I can almost convince myself a good analyst would have saved you: for I need to believe, as always, that your pervasive sense of disappointment proceeded from trivial desires: but I fear that beneath the wish to be a movie star, cowboy, empire builder, all those cheap desires, lay radical disaffection from the very possibilities of human life ... Your wishes were too simple: or too complex.III I find it difficult to imagine you in bed, making love to a woman ... By common consensus, you were a good lover: and yet, mother once said: “Marriage would be better if it weren’t mixed up with sex ...” Just after the divorce,—when I was about five,—I slept all night with you in a motel, and again and again you begged me to beg her to come back ... I said nothing; but she went back several times, again and again you would go on a binge, there would be another woman, mother would leave ... You always said, “Your mother is the only woman I’ve ever loved.”IV Oh Shank, don’t turn into the lies of mere, neat poetry ... I’ve been reading Jung, and he says that we can never get to the bottom of what is, or was ... But why things were as they were obsesses; I know that you the necessity to contend with you your helplessness before yourself, —has been at the center of how I think my life ... And yet your voice, raw, demanding, dissatisfied, saying over the telephone: “How are all those bastards at Harvard?” remains, challenging: beyond all the patterns and paradigms I use to silence and stop it.V I dreamed I had my wish: —I seemed to see the conditions of my life, upon a luminous stage: how I could change, how I could not: the root of necessity, and choice. The stage was labelled “Insight”. The actors there had no faces, I cannot remember the patterns of their actions, but simply by watching, I knew that beneath my feet the fixed stars governing my life had begun to fall, and melt ... —Then your face appeared, laughing at the simplicity of my wish.VI Almost every day I take out the letter you wrote me in Paris. ... Why? It was written the year before you married Shirley; Myrtle, your girlfriend, was an ally of mine because she “took care of you,” but you always made it clear she was too dumpy and crude to marry ... In some ways “elegant,” with a pencil-thin, neatly clipped moustache, chiselled, Roman nose, you were a millionaire and always pretended you couldn’t afford to go to Europe ... When I was a child, you didn’t seem to care if I existed. Bakersfield, Calif July 9, 1961 Dear Pinon, Sorry I haven’t wrote to you sooner but glad to hear that you are well and enjoying Paris. I got your fathers day wire in the hospital where I put in about twelve days but I am very well now. I quit the ciggeretts but went through ten days of hell quitting and my back had been giving me hell. It had been very hot here but the last few days has been very nice. Emily just got out of the hospital yesterday. She had her feet worked on. I guess she will tell you about it. Glad to hear you are learning some French. We are just about through with potatoes.

\"When I hit her on the head, it was good, and then I did it to her a couple of times,— but it was funny,—afterwards, it was as if somebody else did it... Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line. Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay, tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss, hop out and do it to her... The whole buggy of them waiting for me made me feel good; but still, just like I knew all along, she didn't move. When the body got too discomposed, I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her... —It sounds crazy, but I tell you sometimes it was beautiful—; I don't know how to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible—; and then, then,— well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw, under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud: and I knew I couldn't have done that,— somebody else had to have done that,— standing above her there, in those ordinary, shitty leaves... —One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was staying with a woman; but she was gone; you could smell the wine in the air; and he started, real embarrassing, to cry... He was still a little drunk, and he asked me to forgive him for all he hadn't done—; but, What the shit? Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards not even his own kids? I got in the truck, and started to drive, and saw a little girl— who I picked up, hit on the head, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then buried, in the garden of the motel... —You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted to feel things make sense: I remember looking out the window of my room back home,— and being almost suffocated by the asphalt; and grass; and trees; and glass; just there, just there, doing nothing! not saying anything! filling me up— but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me; —how I wanted to see beneath it, cut beneath it, and make it somehow, come alive... The salt of the earth; Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth...' —That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel I had passed a million times on the road, everything fit together; was alright; it seemed like everything had to be there, like I had spent years trying, and at last finally finished drawing this huge circle... —But then, suddenly I knew somebody else did it, some bastard had hurt a little girl—; the motel I could see again, it had been itself all the time, a lousy pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to have to be there,—but was, just by chance... —Once, on the farm, when I was a kid, I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck when he tried to get away pulled tight;—and just when I came, he died... I came back the next day; jacked off over his body; but it didn't do any good... Mom once said: 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.' I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else; but didn't do any good... —About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried, so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see if he was happy. She was twenty-five years younger than him: she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why, I felt shaky... I stopped in front of the address; and snuck up to the window to look in... —There he was, a kid six months old on his lap, laughing and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age to play the papa after years of sleeping around,— it twisted me up... To think that what he wouldn't give me, he wanted to give them... I could have killed the bastard... —Naturally, I just got right back in the car, and believe me, was determined, determined, to head straight for home... but the more I drove, I kept thinking about getting a girl, and the more I thought I shouldn't do it, the more I had to— I saw her coming out of the movies, saw she was alone, and kept circling the blocks as she walked along them, saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.' 'You're going to leave her alone.' —The woods were scary! As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more of the skull show through, the nights became clearer, and the buds,—erect, like nipples... —But t@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What none knows is when, not if. Now that your life nears its end when you turn back what you see is ruin. You think, It is a prison. No, it is a vast resonating chamber in which each thing you say or do is new, but the same. What none knows is how to change. Each plateau you reach, if single, limited, only itself, in- cludes traces of all the others, so that in the end limitation frees you, there is no end, if you once see what is there to see. You cannot see what is there to see — not when she whose love you failed is standing next to you. Then, as if refusing the know- ledge that life unseparated from her is death, as if again scorning your refusals, she turns away. The end achieved by the unappeased is burial within. Familiar spirit, within whose care I grew, within whose disappointment I twist, may we at last see by what necessity the double-bind is in the end the figure for human life, why what we love is precluded always by something else we love, as if each no we speak is yes, each yes no. The prospect is mixed but elsewhere the forecast is no better. The eyrie where you perch in exhaustion has food and is out of the wind, if cold. You feel old, young, old, young: you scan the sea for movement, though the promise of sex or food is the prospect that bewildered you to this end. Something in you believes that it is not the end. When you wake, sixth grade will start. The finite you know you fear is infinite: even at eleven, what you love is what you should not love, which endless bullies in- tuit unerringly. The future will be different: you cannot see the end. What none knows is when, not if.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

As the retreating Bructeri began to burn their own possessions, to deny to the Romans every sustenance but ashes, a flying column sent by Germanicus commanded by Lucius Stertinius routed them; and there, discovered amid plunder and the dead, was the Eagle of the nineteenth legion, lost with Varus. * The Romans now brought to the land of the Bructeri,—to whatever lay between the river Ems and the river Lippe, to the very edge of their territory,— devastation; until they reached at last the Teutoburgian Wood, in whose darkness Varus and the remains of his fifteen thousand men, it was said, lay unburied. * Germanicus then conceived a desire to honor with obsequies these unburied warriors whose massacre once filled Augustus himself with rage and shame,— with hope or fear every corner of the Empire,— while the least foot soldier, facing alien terrain, was overcome with pity when he thought of family, friends, the sudden reversals of battle, and shared human fate. * First Caecina and his men entered,— ordered to reconnoitre the dismal treacherous passes, to attempt to build bridges and causeways across the uneven, sodden marshland,— then the rest of the army, witness to scenes rending to sight and memory of sight. * Varus’ first camp, with its wide sweep and deployment of ordered space in confident dimension, testified to the calm labors of three legions;— then a ruined half-wall and shallow ditch showed where a desperate remnant had been driven to take cover;— on the open ground between them were whitening bones, free from putrefaction,— scattered where men had been struck down fleeing, heaped up where they had stood their ground before slaughter. Fragments of spears and horses’ limbs lay intertwined, while human skulls were nailed like insults to the tree-trunks. Nearby groves held the altars on which the savage Germans sacrificed the tribunes and chief centurions. * Survivors of the catastrophe slowly began, at last, to speak,— the handful who had escaped death or slavery told their fellow soldiers where the generals fell, how the Eagles and standards were seized;— one showed where Varus received his first wound, and another, where he died by his own melancholy hand;— those thrown into crude pits saw gibbets above them, as well as the platform from which Arminius as if in delirium harangued his own victorious troops,— fury and rancor so joined to his joy, the imprisoned men thought they would soon be butchered,— until desecration of the Eagles at last satisfied or exhausted his arrogance. * And so, six years after the slaughter, a living Roman army had returned to bury the dead men’s bones of three whole legions,— no man knew whether the remains that he had gathered, touched perhaps in consigning to the earth, were those of a stranger or a friend:— all thought of all as comrades and bloodbrothers; each, in common rising fury against the enemy, mourned at once and hated. * When these events were reported to Rome Cynics whispered that thus the cunning State enslaves us to its failures and its fate.— Epicureans saw in the ghostly mire an emblem of the nature of Desire.— Stoics replied that life is War, ILLUSION the source, the goal, the end of human action. * At the dedication of the funeral mound, Germanicus laid the first earth,— thereby honoring the dead, and choosing to demonstrate in his own person his heartfelt share in the general grief. He thereby earned the disapproval of Tiberius,— perhaps because the Emperor interpreted every action of Germanicus unfavorably; or he may have felt the spectacle of the unburied dead must give the army less alacrity for battle and more respect for the enemy— while a commander belonging to the antique priesthood of the Augurs pollutes himself by handling objects belonging to the dead. * on the open ground whitening bones scattered where men had been struck down fleeing heaped up where they stood their ground Varus’ first camp with its wide sweep across the open ground the ruined half-wall and shallow ditch on the open ground between them@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We are electric ghosts. • You hear the strange cricket in the oven sing, and ask what it sings. This is what it sings. Because Benvenuto in my native tongue means welcome, write here lies an artist who did not recoil from residence on earth — but, truly named, welcomed it. But I mis-spoke: not wife. Servant: model: mother of my child, also now dead. • In prison, immured in the black pit where the Pope once fed Benedetto da Foiano less and less each day until God’s will, not the Pope’s own hand, killed him, — where outside my door each day the castellan repeated that darkness will teach me I am a counterfeit bat, and he a real one, — blackness, silence so unremitted I knew I had survived another day only by the malignant welcome singsong of his triumphant voice, — Benvenuto is a counterfeit bat, and I a real one, — where God had not found me worthy of seeing the sun even in a dream, I asked the God of Nature what unexpiated act the suffocation of my senses, such suffering, serv@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This is the time of year when almost every night the frail, illegal fire balloons appear. Climbing the mountain height, rising toward a saint still honored in these parts, the paper chambers flush and fill with light that comes and goes, like hearts. Once up against the sky it's hard to tell them from the stars— planets, that is—the tinted ones: Venus going down, or Mars, or the pale green one. With a wind, they flare and falter, wobble and toss; but if it's still they steer between the kite sticks of the Southern Cross, receding, dwindling, solemnly and steadily forsaking us, or, in the downdraft from a peak, suddenly turning dangerous. Last night another big one fell. It splattered like an egg of fire against the cliff behind the house. The flame ran down. We saw the pair of owls who nest there flying up and up, their whirling black-and-white stained bright pink underneath, until they shrieked up out of sight. The ancient owls' nest must have burned. Hastily, all alone, a glistening armadillo left the scene, rose-flecked, head down, tail down, and then a baby rabbit jumped out,short-eared, to our surprise. So soft!—a handful of intangible ash with fixed, ignited eyes.Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!O falling fire and piercing cry and panic, and a weak mailed fistclenched ignorant against the sky!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here is a coast; here is a harbor; here, after a meager diet of horizon, is some scenery; impractically shaped and—who knows?—self-pitying mountains, sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery, with a little church on top of one. And warehouses, some of them painted a feeble pink, or blue, and some tall, uncertain palms. Oh, tourist, is this how this country is going to answer you and your immodest demands for a different world, and a better life, and complete comprehension of both at last, and immediately, after eighteen days of suspension? Finish your breakfast. The tender is coming, a strange and ancient craft, flying a strange and brillant rag. So that's the flag. I never saw it before. I somehow never thought of there being a flag, but of course there was, all along. And coins, I presume, and paper money; they remain to be seen. And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward, myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen, descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters waiting to be loaded with green coffee beans. Please, boy, do be more careful with that boat hook! Watch out! Oh! It has caught Miss Breen's skirt! There! Miss Breen is about seventy, a retired police lieutenant, six feet tall, with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression. Her home, when she is at home, is in Glens Fall s, New York. There. We are settled. The customs officials will speak English, we hope, and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes. Ports are necessities, like postage stamps, or soap, but they seldom seem to care what impression they make, or, like this, only attempt, since it does not matter, the unassertive colors of soap, or postage stamps— wasting away like the former, slipping the way the latter do when we mail the letteres we wrote on the boat, either because the glue here is very inferior or because of the heat. We leave Santos at once; we are driving to the interior. January 1952@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting, his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, a dark purple-brown, and his shuttle worn and polished. The air smells so strong of codfish it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water. The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls. The big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail, with small iridescent flies crawling on them. Up on the little slope behind the houses, set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, is an ancient wooden capstan, cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted. The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. He was a friend of my grandfather. We talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in. There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, the blade of which is almost worn away. Down at the water’s edge, at the place where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp descending into the water, thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones, down and down at intervals of four or five feet. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, element bearable to no mortal, to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly I have seen here evening after evening. He was curious about me. He was interested in music; like me a believer in total immersion, so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. I also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” He stood up in the water and regarded me steadily, moving his head a little. Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, the dignified tall firs begin. Bluish, associating with their shadows, a million Christmas trees stand waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. If you should dip your hand in, your wrist would ache immediately, your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A new volcano has erupted, the papers say, and last week I was reading where some ship saw an island being born: at first a breath of steam, ten miles away; and then a black fleck—basalt, probably— rose in the mate’s binoculars and caught on the horizon like a fly. They named it. But my poor old island’s still un-rediscovered, un-renamable. None of the books has ever got it right. Well, I had fifty-two miserable, small volcanoes I could climb with a few slithery strides— volcanoes dead as ash heaps. I used to sit on the edge of the highest one and count the others standing up, naked and leaden, with their heads blown off. I’d think that if they were the size I thought volcanoes should be, then I had become a giant; and if I had become a giant, I couldn’t bear to think what size the goats and turtles were, or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers —a glittering hexagon of rollers closing and closing in, but never quite, glittering and glittering, though the sky was mostly overcast. My island seemed to be a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere’s left-over clouds arrived and hung above the craters—their parched throats were hot to touch. Was that why it rained so much? And why sometimes the whole place hissed? The turtles lumbered by, high-domed, hissing like teakettles. (And I’d have given years, or taken a few, for any sort of kettle, of course.) The folds of lava, running out to sea, would hiss. I’d turn. And then they’d prove to be more turtles. The beaches were all lava, variegated, black, red, and white, and gray; the marbled colors made a fine display. And I had waterspouts. Oh, half a dozen at a time, far out, they’d come and go, advancing and retreating, their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches of scuffed-up white. Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated, sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched the water spiral up in them like smoke. Beautiful, yes, but not much company. I often gave way to self-pity. “Do I deserve this? I suppose I must. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Was there a moment when I actually chose this? I don’t remember, but there could have been.” What’s wrong about self-pity, anyway? With my legs dangling down familiarly over a crater’s edge, I told myself “Pity should begin at home.” So the more pity I felt, the more I felt at home. The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun rose from the sea, and there was one of it and one of me. The island had one kind of everything: one tree snail, a bright violet-blue with a thin shell, crept over everything, over the one variety of tree, a sooty, scrub affair. Snail shells lay under these in drifts and, at a distance, you’d swear that they were beds of irises. There was one kind of berry, a dark red. I tried it, one by one, and hours apart. Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects; and so I made home-brew. I’d drink the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff that went straight to my head and play my home-made flute (I think it had the weirdest scale on earth) and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats. Home-made, home-made! But aren’t we all? I felt a deep affection for the smallest of my island industries. No, not exactly, since the smallest was a miserable philosophy. Because I didn’t know enough. Why didn’t I know enough of something? Greek drama or astronomy? The books I’d read were full of blanks; the poems—well, I tried reciting to my iris-beds, “They flash upon that inward eye, which is the bliss ...” The bliss of what? One of the first things that I did when I got back was look it up. The island smelled of goat and guano. The goats were white, so were the gulls, and both too tame, or else they thought I was a goat, too, or a gull.Baa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek, baa ... shriek ... baa ... I still can’t shake them from my ears; they’re hurting now. The questioning shrieks, the equivocal replies over a ground of hissing rain and hissing, ambulating turtles got on my nerves. When all the gulls flew up at once, they sounded like a big tree in a strong wind, its leaves. I’d shut my eyes a@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Oh, but it is dirty! —this little filling station, oil-soaked, oil-permeated to a disturbing, over-all black translucency. Be careful with that match! Father wears a dirty, oil-soaked monkey suit that cuts him under the arms, and several quick and saucy and greasy sons assist him (it’s a family filling station), all quite thoroughly dirty. Do they live in the station? It has a cement porch behind the pumps, and on it a set of crushed and grease- impregnated wickerwork; on the wicker sofa a dirty dog, quite comfy. Some comic books provide the only note of color— of certain color. They lie upon a big dim doily draping a taboret (part of the set), beside a big hirsute begonia. Why the extraneous plant? Why the taboret? Why, oh why, the doily? (Embroidered in daisy stitch with marguerites, I think, and heavy with gray crochet.) Somebody embroidered the doily. Somebody waters the plant, or oils it, maybe. Somebody arranges the rows of cans so that they softly say:esso—so—so—so to high-strung automobiles. Somebody loves us all.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily like a dog looking for a place to sleep in, listen to it growling. Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys lying out there unresponsive to the lightning in dark, coarse-fibred families, where occasionally a heron may undo his head, shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment when the surrounding water shines. Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons. It is raining there. The boulevard and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened. Now the storm goes away again in a series of small, badly lit battle-scenes, each in \"Another part of the field.\" Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge; think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here, above, cracks in the buildings are filled with battered moonlight. The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat. It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on, and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon. He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties, feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold, of a temperature impossible to record in thermometers. But when the Man-Moth pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface, the moon looks rather different to him. He emerges from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings. He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky, proving the sky quite useless for protection. He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb. Up the façades, his shadow dragging like a photographer’s cloth behind him he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage to push his small head through that round clean opening and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light. (Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.) But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt. Then he returns to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits, he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains fast enough to suit him. The doors close swiftly. The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed, without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort. He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards. Each night he must be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams. Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie his rushing brain. He does not dare look out the window, for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison, runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease he has inherited the susceptibility to. He has to keep his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers. If you catch him, hold up a flashlight to his eye. It’s all dark pupil, an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens as he stares back, and closes up the eye. Then from the lids one tear, his only possession, like the bee’s sting, slips. Slyly he palms it, and if you’re not paying attention he’ll swallow it. However, if you watch, he’ll hand it over, cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The art of losing isn’t hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster. Lose something every day. Accept the fluster of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. The art of losing isn’t hard to master. Then practice losing farther, losing faster: places, and names, and where it was you meant to travel. None of these will bring disaster. I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or next-to-last, of three loved houses went. The art of losing isn’t hard to master. I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.

At four o’clock in the gun-metal blue dark we hear the first crow of the first cock just below the gun-metal blue window and immediately there is an echo off in the distance, then one from the backyard fence, then one, with horrible insistence, grates like a wet match from the broccoli patch, flares, and all over town begins to catch. Cries galore come from the water-closet door, from the dropping-plastered henhouse floor, where in the blue blur their rustling wives admire, the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare with stupid eyes while from their beaks there rise the uncontrolled, traditional cries. Deep from protruding chests in green-gold medals dressed, planned to command and terrorize the rest, the many wives who lead hens’ lives of being courted and despised; deep from raw throats a senseless order floats all over town. A rooster gloats over our beds from rusty iron sheds and fences made from old bedsteads, over our churches where the tin rooster perches, over our little wooden northern houses, making sallies from all the muddy alleys, marking out maps like Rand McNally’s: glass-headed pins, oil-golds and copper greens, anthracite blues, alizarins, each one an active displacement in perspective; each screaming, “This is where I live!” Each screaming “Get up! Stop dreaming!” Roosters, what are you projecting? You, whom the Greeks elected to shoot at on a post, who struggled when sacrificed, you whom they labeled “Very combative ...” what right have you to give commands and tell us how to live, cry “Here!” and “Here!” and wake us here where are unwanted love, conceit and war? The crown of red set on your little head is charged with all your fighting blood. Yes, that excrescence makes a most virile presence, plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence. Now in mid-air by twos they fight each other. Down comes a first flame-feather, and one is flying, with raging heroism defying even the sensation of dying. And one has fallen, but still above the town his torn-out, bloodied feathers drift down; and what he sung no matter. He is flung on the gray ash-heap, lies in dung with his dead wives with open, bloody eyes, while those metallic feathers oxidize. St. Peter’s sin was worse than that of Magdalen whose sin was of the flesh alone; of spirit, Peter’s, falling, beneath the flares, among the “servants and officers.” Old holy sculpture could set it all together in one small scene, past and future: Christ stands amazed, Peter, two fingers raised to surprised lips, both as if dazed. But in between a little cock is seen carved on a dim column in the travertine, explained by gallus canit;flet Petrus underneath it. There is inescapable hope, the pivot; yes, and there Peter’s tears run down our chanticleer’s sides and gem his spurs. Tear-encrusted thick as a medieval relic he waits. Poor Peter, heart-sick, still cannot guess those cock-a-doodles yet might bless, his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness, a new weathervane on basilica and barn, and that outside the Lateran there would always be a bronze cock on a porphyry pillar so the people and the Pope might see that even the Prince of the Apostles long since had been forgiven, and to convince all the assembly that “Deny deny deny” is not all the roosters cry. In the morning a low light is floating in the backyard, and gilding from underneath the broccoli, leaf by leaf; how could the night have come to grief? gilding the tiny floating swallow’s belly and lines of pink cloud in the sky, the day’s preamble like wandering lines in marble. The cocks are now almost inaudible. The sun climbs in, following “to see the end,” faithful as enemy, or friend.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The body would like a small mile or two. Thank you. It would like it on a bike or a run. Or in the water. Blue. And food. A habit that involves a larger circumference where a garden’s involved, beer is brewed, cows wake the farmer with their fullness, a field surrenders its wheat, and wheat understands I will be crushed into flour and starry-dust the whole room, the baker sweating, opening a window to acknowledge such remarkable confetti. And the brain, locked in its strange dual citizenship, idles there in the body, neatly terraced and landscaped. Or left to ruin, such a brain, wild roses growing next to the sea. The body is gracious about that. Oh, their scent sometimes. Their tangle. In truth, in secret, the first thing in morning the eye longs to see.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Or the room could, its three doors, two windows or the house on a slant touching, touched by the drift down street, cars pressing quick or slowing.

It seems so— I don’t know. It seems as if the end of the world has never happened in here. No smoke, no dizzy flaring except those candles you can light in the chapel for a quarter. They last maybe an hour before burning out. And in this room where we wait, I see them pass, the surgical folk— nurses, doctors, the guy who hangs up the blood drop—ready for lunch, their scrubs still starched into wrinkles, a cheerful green or pale blue, and the end of a joke, something about a man who thought he could be— what? I lose it in their brief laughter.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

And trees, of course they wanted to fall. It was their time or something equally sonorous. And wind too knows its mindless little whirlpool's not for nothing, not nothing—that pitch and rage stopped.

I found Rome in the woods. Fair to admit it’s mostly tundra to the west in the park, past Toklat the Denali I revised, low grasslands engineered to freeze deep by October — this being Alaska — the great Tabularium close to the Temple of Castor and Pollux I rebuilt that same summer — not superimposed, exact as any scheme in secret — the Arch of Septimius Severus at the gravel bar where fox drank from a river turned stream, a Theater of Marcellus near the ranger station where one raven, such a brat, complained of my Circus Maximus, Trajan’s Column, my Baths of Diocletian, too many spots soaked in unpronounceable Latin. I really did, I shouldered bits of it, a ruin-hushed haunted business, my brain a truck bed, a lift, pulleys big as a whale’s heart, expletives of cheap wonder all over my woodlot and expanse. One self-anoints to embellish day, years, life thus far, and think oneself so ... Then busted — by a raven! Well, that’s memory for you, that’s so-called civilization for you, to layer up, to redo the already done. I mean it’s a fact, the puny life span we’re allotted. And proof — Denali in August, fireweed, spunky scrawny first Latinate — Erechtites hieracifolia — giving off flowers to mark what weeks left, little time bomber, time traveler, ancient slips red-flagging the countdown to winter by climbing its own stalk. Something perverse about that. Something perfectly fiendishly self-conscious about that. • From the start perverse, any premise. Ask ... We can’t know. To be compelled makes an occasion. Rome’s grand past horrific, fire and ash, swamp into bog, lust and bloodlust — The Alaska Range dreams lurid as Rome, the worst way below being fire, summer snow at night off the highest peaks by noon as distant from our cabin as the size of a hand if I held up the one with an eye in the middle to know how this works. Some have the power to raise from the dead a before, before scary and beautiful back to mystery cults, in caves, rubble far under a Roman street, the altar to Mithras still slaying his bull, crumbling the stonework. All things being equal. But they’re not. Agony, it’s older. Ask the moose at Denali, the snowshoe hare, the lynx, such a wily courtly lot. Ask Ovid banished to his hovel on the Black Sea, aching for Rome’s exalted rude cacophony, each exiled month a big thick X down Februarius, Aprilis to home-shattered sick enough for an undersong. Look it up! Undersong: a strain; a droning; the burden of a song — Maybe that lowest common denominator is contagious. Rome or Denali, a mash-up of lunge and cry out, predator and prey throwing coins to a fountain, footholds made first by a hoof, pickpockets at buses and trains, nuns queuing up their no-nonsense, thorny brambles, raggedy spruce groves, a look, a nod to sell loveless love on the street, a chain of mountains in choral repeat, saints stained to glass, how ice gouged rivers from rock-bound, the one-lung rapturous common-sense Pope all outstretched arms, his little popemobile circling the thrilled at St. Peter’s up on our rickety chairs to see in six, seven languages how radiant — Cross my heart, he was. And Keats, Keats is coughing. • You find the fossil record everywhere. In woods, tundra, under streets, in cadaver labs. Not those bright transparencies, wistful orderly page after page in biology, a lie, a kind of flip-book romance. It’s the one big mess of us in us, the generous extraordinary dead prove that, signing a paper, giving themselves away to be cut, disembodied for the knowing it, sunk to their chemical depth in some afterlife, opened on a table by kids really, belabored doctors-to-be, our shabby shared wilderness to untangle, bones joints arteries valves, The Dissector in hand, weirdest how-to book on the planet. For Keats too, 1819, his scribbled roses and sunflowers in margins, his training, his anatomy theatre, looking down and later: still London, then Rome (he who gets it, body fails, second floor, beside the Spanish Steps).

I walked out, and the nest was already there by the step. Woven basket of a saint sent back to life as a bird who proceeded to make a mess of things. Wind right through it, and any eggs long vanished. But in my hand it was intricate pleasure, even the thorny reeds softened in the weave.

I gave up the pencil, the walk in woods, the fog at dawn, a keyhole I lost an eye to. And the habit of early, of acorn into oak— bent tangled choked because of ache or greed, or lousy light deemed it so. So what. Give up that so what. O fellow addicts of the arch and the tragic, give up the thousand-pound if and when too. Give up whatever made the bed or unmade it. Give up the know thing that shatters into other things and takes the remember fork in the road. The remember isn’t a road. At noon, the fog has no memory of fog, the trees I walked or wanted to. Like the pencil never recalls its least little mark, the dash loved, the comma which can’t, cannot dig down what its own brief nothing means on the page. I don’t understand death either. By afternoon, the brain is box, is breath let go, a kind of mood music agog, half emptied by the usual who am I, who are you, who’s anyone. Truth is, I listen all night for morning, all day for night in the trees draped like a sound I never quite get how it goes. There’s a phantom self, nerved-up as any arm or leg. Of course I was. Of course I stared from the yard, my mother at the window rinsing knife and spoon and the middle of her life. In drawing class, all eyes fix on the figure gone imaginary, thinning to paper. Not the wind or a cry how the hand makes, our bent to it— pause and rush, rush and pause— small animals heard only at dark, spooked in the leaves.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Like that first daguerreotype, its moving carriages and those who strolled never picked up in the long exposure, a Paris street emptied by the camera, only houses and lamp posts gone eternal. Or the one who stopped for a shoe shine, the one who knelt to the task. At the picnic—a commotion. A large man to a younger man. I don’t know you! he’s hugging and laughing.

Beneath the waver of the dorsal fin lie the blood-shades of lamellae, their skin so close to the vein they breathe, filter, gather, flex, set down in loose and frangible parallels you find in gills of mushrooms, clams, and concertinas. Wave after wave, the tissues of the water breathers conceal what they reveal, according to their vital rhythm. Fins that breathe flit this way, that, in the give-and-take of panic and lust and tropical surge from no one place. To every fish, flesh, nightmare, and song: a private opening and the name it bears. Let us call it tomorrow or lament, the heart of my volition. To every want the one who wants, chosen, given, taken in. To every bride, the lamellae of the sugar and sleeve. Layers of lace that advertise the power of enclosure, how, in some siege of arrival, a white interior lathers the shore. Somewhere downwind the music at the altar, both bride and gown take a shape. One part surge, another spray. One part the urging of the processional march. A woman wets the mouthpiece of her oboe, blows, adjusts the angle with her fingers. She understands the value of a quality double reed, the thin resilient tip that, when sounded, vanishes from view. The better lamellae take time. The better harvest from cane fields of a southern France. First the cut, the cure, the second shape and then, by laser-beam, a third, and finally the carve of a craftsman who will go nameless. Now we are coming to the passage reminiscent of a fish. We are speaking a loose-limbed language as it swims the caverns, in the ear, out the mouth, encircling the future groom, asleep, and the body of his bride beside him, almost there. Our darkness breathes more deeply in the dark. Somewhere a fly taps the window and dies. Night’s web flutters. A mushroom slips the bricks of the drive. It wants in, and out, and neither, revealed and concealed as childhood is, and music will be, and all we lost, seek, and never find. We are coming to the passage reminiscent of a tune though we cannot know just what or where. When I was a boy, my skin was so thin I spent most days alone. I wandered the yard and was its lord, its terror, its scared apprentice. Mostly I was no one. I was just that transparent, that adrift. Beneath the brim of the cap, the mushroom’s papery fan broke to pieces at my touch. It crumpled the way the bodies do beneath a shared diagnosis. I thought I killed the pattern in my hand, but what I held were spores. Beneath the umbrella of a new cloud, what I felt was the first light breath of rain.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead! There’s none of these so lonely and poor of old, But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold. These laid the world away; poured out the red Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, That men call age; and those who would have been, Their sons, they gave, their immortality. Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth, Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain, Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, And paid his subjects with a royal wage; And Nobleness walks in our ways again; And we have come into our heritage.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
These hearts were woven of human joys and cares, Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, And sunset, and the colours of the earth. These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended. There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after, Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance, A width, a shining peace, under the night.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I strayed about the deck, an hour, to-night Under a cloudy moonless sky; and peeped In at the windows, watched my friends at table, Or playing cards, or standing in the doorway, Or coming out into the darkness. Still No one could see me. I would have thought of them—Heedless, within a week of battle—in pity, Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness And link’d beauty of bodies, and pity that This gay machine of splendour ’ld soon be broken, Thought little of, pashed, scattered. … Only, always, I could but see them—against the lamplight—pass Like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass, Slight bubbles, fainter than the wave’s faint light, That broke to phosphorus out in the night, Perishing things and strange ghosts—soon to die To other ghosts—this one, or that, or I.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I see you, who were so wise and cool, Gazing with silly sickness on that fool You’ve given your love to, your adoring hands Touch his so intimately that each understands, I know, most hidden things; and when I know Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow Of his red lips, and that the empty grace Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face, Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love, That you have given him every touch and move, Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life, —Oh! then I know I’m waiting, lover-wife, For the great time when love is at a close, And all its fruit’s to watch the thickening nose And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye, That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die! Day after day you’ll sit with him and note The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat; As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat, And love, love, love to habit! And after that, When all that’s fine in man is at an end, And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old, When his rare lips hang flabby and can’t hold Slobber, and you’re enduring that worst thing, Senility’s queasy furtive love-making, And searching those dear eyes for human meaning, Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning A scrap that life’s flung by, and love’s forgotten,— Then you’ll be tired; and passion dead and rotten; And he’ll be dirty, dirty! O lithe and free And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see, That’s how I’ll see your man and you!— But you —Oh, when that time comes, you’ll be dirty too!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour, And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping! With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power, To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary; Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, And all the little emptiness of love! Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there, But only agony, and that has ending; And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In your arms was still delight,Quiet as a street at night;And thoughts of you, I do remember,Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.Love, in you, went passing by,Penetrative, remote, and rare,Like a bird in the wide air,And, as the bird, it left no traceIn the heaven of your face.In your stupidity I foundThe sweet hush after a sweet sound.All about you was the lightThat dims the greying end of night;Desire was the unrisen sun,Joy the day not yet begun,With tree whispering to tree,Without wind, quietly.Wisdom slept within your hair,And Long-Suffering was there,And, in the flowing of your dress,Undiscerning Tenderness.And when you thought, it seemed to me,Infinitely, and like a sea,About the slight world you had knownYour vast unsconsciousness was thrown . . . O haven without wave or tide!Silence, in which all songs have died!Holy book, where hearts are still!And home at length under the hill!O mother quiet, breasts of peace,Where love itself would faint and cease!O infinite deep I never knew,I would come back, come back to you,Find you, as a pool unstirred,Kneel down by you, and never a word,Lay my head, and nothing said,In your hands, ungarlanded;And a long watch you would keep;And I should sleep, and I should sleep!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest He who has found our hid security, Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest, And heard our word, ‘Who is so safe as we?’ We have found safety with all things undying, The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth, The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying, And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth. We have built a house that is not for Time’s throwing. We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever. War knows no power. Safe shall be my going, Secretly armed against all death’s endeavour; Safe though all safety’s lost; safe where men fall; And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If I should die, think only this of me: That there’s some corner of a foreign field That is for ever England. There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam; A body of England’s, breathing English air, Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, A pulse in the eternal mind, no less Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.Poetry Out Loud Note: This poem has had two titles: “The Soldier” and “Nineteen-Fourteen: The Soldier”.

Mamua, when our laughter ends, And hearts and bodies, brown as white, Are dust about the doors of friends, Or scent ablowing down the night, Then, oh! then, the wise agree, Comes our immortality. Mamua, there waits a land Hard for us to understand. Out of time, beyond the sun, All are one in Paradise, You and Pupure are one, And Taü, and the ungainly wise. There the Eternals are, and there The Good, the Lovely, and the True, And Types, whose earthly copies were The foolish broken things we knew; There is the Face, whose ghosts we are; The real, the never-setting Star; And the Flower, of which we love Faint and fading shadows here; Never a tear, but only Grief; Dance, but not the limbs that move; Songs in Song shall disappear; Instead of lovers, Love shall be; For hearts, Immutability; And there, on the Ideal Reef, Thunders the Everlasting Sea! And my laughter, and my pain, Shall home to the Eternal Brain. And all lovely things, they say, Meet in Loveliness again; Miri’s laugh, Teïpo’s feet, And the hands of Matua, Stars and sunlight there shall meet Coral’s hues and rainbows there, And Teüra’s braided hair; And with the starred tiare’s white, And white birds in the dark ravine, And flamboyants ablaze at night, And jewels, and evening’s after-green, And dawns of pearl and gold and red, Mamua, your lovelier head! And there’ll no more be one who dreams Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff, Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems, All time-entangled human love. And you’ll no longer swing and sway Divinely down the scented shade, Where feet to Ambulation fade, And moons are lost in endless Day. How shall we wind these wreaths of ours, Where there are neither heads nor flowers? Oh, Heaven’s Heaven!—but we’ll be missing The palms, and sunlight, and the south; And there’s an end, I think, of kissing, When our mouths are one with Mouth.... Taü here, Mamua, Crown the hair, and come away! Hear the calling of the moon, And the whispering scents that stray About the idle warm lagoon. Hasten, hand in human hand, Down the dark, the flowered way, Along the whiteness of the sand, And in the water’s soft caress, Wash the mind of foolishness, Mamua, until the day. Spend the glittering moonlight there Pursuing down the soundless deep Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair, Or floating lazy, half-asleep. Dive and double and follow after, Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call, With lips that fade, and human laughter And faces individual, Well this side of Paradise! .... There’s little comfort in the wise.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Rudolph Reed was oaken. His wife was oaken too. And his two good girls and his good little man Oakened as they grew. “I am not hungry for berries. I am not hungry for bread. But hungry hungry for a house Where at night a man in bed ”May never hear the plaster Stir as if in pain. May never hear the roaches Falling like fat rain. “Where never wife and children need Go blinking through the gloom. Where every room of many rooms Will be full of room. ”Oh my home may have its east or west Or north or south behind it. All I know is I shall know it, And fight for it when I find it.“ It was in a street of bitter white That he made his application. For Rudolph Reed was oakener Than others in the nation. The agent’s steep and steady stare Corroded to a grin.Why, you black old, tough old hell of a man, Move your family in! Nary a grin grinned Rudolph Reed, Nary a curse cursed he, But moved in his House. With his dark little wife, And his dark little children three. A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye That squeezed into a slit. But the Rudolph Reeds and the children three Were too joyous to notice it. For were they not firm in a home of their own With windows everywhere And a beautiful banistered stair And a front yard for flowers and a back yard for grass? The first night, a rock, big as two fists. The second, a rock big as three. But nary a curse cursed Rudolph Reed. (Though oaken as man could be.) The third night, a silvery ring of glass. Patience ached to endure. But he looked, and lo! small Mabel’s blood Was staining her gaze so pure. Then up did rise our Rudolph Reed And pressed the hand of his wife, And went to the door with a thirty-four And a beastly butcher knife. He ran like a mad thing into the night. And the words in his mouth were stinking. By the time he had hurt his first white man He was no longer thinking. By the time he had hurt his fourth white man Rudolph Reed was dead. His neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse. ”Nigger—“ his neighbors said. Small Mabel whimpered all night long, For calling herself the cause. Her oak-eyed mother did no thing But change the bloody gauze.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They eat beans mostly, this old yellow pair. Dinner is a casual affair. Plain chipware on a plain and creaking wood, Tin flatware. Two who are Mostly Good. Two who have lived their day, But keep on putting on their clothes And putting things away. And remembering ... Remembering, with twinklings and twinges, As they lean over the beans in their rented back room that is full of beads and receipts and dolls and cloths, tobacco crumbs, vases and fringes.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I AS SEEN BY DISCIPLINES There they are. Thirty at the corner. Black, raw, ready. Sores in the city that do not want to heal.II THE LEADERS Jeff. Gene. Geronimo. And Bop. They cancel, cure and curry. Hardly the dupes of the downtown thing the cold bonbon, the rhinestone thing. And hardly in a hurry. Hardly Belafonte, King, Black Jesus, Stokely, Malcolm X or Rap. Bungled trophies. Their country is a Nation on no map. Jeff, Gene, Geronimo and Bop in the passionate noon, in bewitching night are the detailed men, the copious men. They curry, cure, they cancel, cancelled images whose Concerts are not divine, vivacious; the different tins are intense last entries; pagan argument; translations of the night. The Blackstone bitter bureaus (bureaucracy is footloose) edit, fuse unfashionable damnations and descent; and exulting, monstrous hand on monstrous hand, construct, strangely, a monstrous pearl or grace.III GANG GIRLSA Rangerette Gang Girls are sweet exotics. Mary Ann uses the nutrients of her orient, but sometimes sighs for Cities of blue and jewel beyond her Ranger rim of Cottage Grove. (Bowery Boys, Disciples, Whip-Birds will dissolve no margins, stop no savory sanctities.) Mary is a rose in a whiskey glass. Mary’s Februaries shudder and are gone. Aprils fret frankly, lilac hurries on. Summer is a hard irregular ridge. October looks away. And that’s the Year! Save for her bugle-love. Save for the bleat of not-obese devotion. Save for Somebody Terribly Dying, under the philanthropy of robins. Save for her Ranger bringing an amount of rainbow in a string-drawn bag. “Where did you get the diamond?” Do not ask: but swallow, straight, the spirals of his flask and assist him at your zipper; pet his lips and help him clutch you. Love’s another departure. Will there be any arrivals, confirmations? Will there be gleaning? Mary, the Shakedancer’s child from the rooming-flat, pants carefully, peers at her laboring lover .... Mary! Mary Ann! Settle for sandwiches! settle for stocking caps! for sudden blood, aborted carnival, the props and niceties of non-loneliness— the rhymes of Leaning.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 People who have no children can be hard: Attain a mail of ice and insolence: Need not pause in the fire, and in no sense Hesitate in the hurricane to guard. And when wide world is bitten and bewarred They perish purely, waving their spirits hence Without a trace of grace or of offense To laugh or fail, diffident, wonder-starred. While through a throttling dark we others hear The little lifting helplessness, the queer Whimper-whine; whose unridiculous Lost softness softly makes a trap for us. And makes a curse. And makes a sugar of The malocclusions, the inconditions of love. 2 What shall I give my children? who are poor, Who are adjudged the leastwise of the land, Who are my sweetest lepers, who demand No velvet and no velvety velour; But who have begged me for a brisk contour, Crying that they are quasi, contraband Because unfinished, graven by a hand Less than angelic, admirable or sure. My hand is stuffed with mode, design, device. But I lack access to my proper stone. And plenitude of plan shall not suffice Nor grief nor love shall be enough alone To ratify my little halves who bear Across an autumn freezing everywhere. 3 And shall I prime my children, pray, to pray? Mites, come invade most frugal vestibules Spectered with crusts of penitents’ renewals And all hysterics arrogant for a day. Instruct yourselves here is no devil to pay. Children, confine your lights in jellied rules; Resemble graves; be metaphysical mules. Learn Lord will not distort nor leave the fray. Behind the scurryings of your neat motif I shall wait, if you wish: revise the psalm If that should frighten you: sew up belief If that should tear: turn, singularly calm At forehead and at fingers rather wise, Holding the bandage ready for your eyes.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Ugliest little boy that everyone ever saw. That is what everyone said. Even to his mother it was apparent— when the blue-aproned nurse came into the northeast end of the maternity ward bearing his squeals and plump bottom looped up in a scant receiving blanket, bending, to pass the bundle carefully into the waiting mother-hands—that this was no cute little ugliness, no sly baby waywardness that was going to inch away as would baby fat, baby curl, and baby spot-rash. The pendulous lip, the branching ears, the eyes so wide and wild, the vague unvibrant brown of the skin, and, most disturbing, the great head. These components of That Look bespoke the sure fibre. The deep grain. His father could not bear the sight of him. His mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair and put him among her hairpins and sweethearts, dance slippers, torn paper roses. He was not less than these, he was not more. As the little Lincoln grew, uglily upward and out, he began to understand that something was wrong. His little ways of trying to please his father, the bringing of matches, the jumping aside at warning sound of oh-so-large and rushing stride, the smile that gave and gave and gave—Unsuccessful! Even Christmases and Easters were spoiled. He would be sitting at the family feasting table, really delighting in the displays of mashed potatoes and the rich golden fat-crust of the ham or the festive fowl, when he would look up and find somebody feeling indignant about him. What a pity what a pity. No love for one so loving. The little Lincoln loved Everybody. Ants. The changing caterpillar. His much-missing mother. His kindergarten teacher. His kindergarten teacher—whose concern for him was composed of one part sympathy and two parts repulsion. The others ran up with their little drawings. He ran up with his. She tried to be as pleasant with him as with others, but it was difficult. For she was all pretty! all daintiness, all tiny vanilla, with blue eyes and fluffy sun-hair. One afternoon she saw him in the hall looking bleak against the wall. It was strange because the bell had long since rung and no other child was in sight. Pity flooded her. She buttoned her gloves and suggested cheerfully that she walk him home. She started out bravely, holding him by the hand. But she had not walked far before she regretted it. The little monkey. Must everyone look? And clutching her hand like that. . . . Literally pinching it. . . . At seven, the little Lincoln loved the brother and sister who moved next door. Handsome. Well- dressed. Charitable, often, to him. They enjoyed him because he was resourceful, made up games, told stories. But when their More Acceptable friends came they turned their handsome backs on him. He hated himself for his feeling of well-being when with them despite— Everything. He spent much time looking at himself in mirrors. What could be done? But there was no shrinking his head. There was no binding his ears. “Don’t touch me!” cried the little fairy-like being in the playground. Her name was Nerissa. The many children were playing tag, but when he caught her, she recoiled, jerked free and ran. It was like all the rainbow that ever was, going off forever, all, all the sparklings in the sunset west. One day, while he was yet seven, a thing happened. In the down-town movies with his mother a white man in the seat beside him whispered loudly to a companion, and pointed at the little Linc. “THERE! That’s the kind I’ve been wanting to show you! One of the best examples of the specie. Not like those diluted Negroes you see so much of on the streets these days, but the real thing. Black, ugly, and odd. You can see the savagery. The blunt blankness. That is the real thing.” His mother—her hair had never looked so red around the dark brown velvet of her face—jumped up, shrieked “Go to—” She did not finish. She yanked to his feet the little Lincoln, who was sitting there staring in fascination at his assessor. At the author of his new idea. All the way home he was happy. Of course, he had not liked the word “u@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Abortions will not let you forget. You remember the children you got that you did not get, The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair, The singers and workers that never handled the air.

You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh, Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye. I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed children. I have contracted. I have eased My dim dears at the breasts they could never suck. I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seized Your luck And your lives from your unfinished reach, If I stole your births and your names, Your straight baby tears and your games, Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches, and your deaths, If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths, Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate. Though why should I whine, Whine that the crime was other than mine?— Since anyhow you are dead. Or rather, or instead, You were never made. But that too, I am afraid, Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said? You were born, you had body, you died. It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried.

Blackness is a title, is a preoccupation, is a commitment Blacks are to comprehend— and in which you are to perceive your Glory. The conscious shout of all that is white is “It’s Great to be white.” The conscious shout of the slack in Black is \"It's Great to be white.\" Thus all that is white has white strength and yours. The word Black has geographic power, pulls everybody in: Blacks here— Blacks there— Blacks wherever they may be. And remember, you Blacks, what they told you— remember your Education: “one Drop—one Drop maketh a brand new Black.” Oh mighty Drop. ______And because they have given us kindly so many more of our people Blackness stretches over the land. Blackness— the Black of it, the rust-red of it, the milk and cream of it, the tan and yellow-tan of it, the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it, the “olive” and ochre of it— Blackness marches on. The huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride is to Comprehend, to salute and to Love the fact that we are Black, which is our “ultimate Reality,” which is the lone ground from which our meaningful metamorphosis, from which our prosperous staccato, group or individual, can rise. Self-shriveled Blacks. Begin with gaunt and marvelous concession: YOU are our costume and our fundamental bone. All of you— you COLORED ones, you NEGRO ones, those of you who proudly cry “I’m half INDian”— those of you who proudly screech “I’VE got the blood of George WASHington in MY veins” ALL of you— you proper Blacks, you half-Blacks, you wish-I-weren’t Blacks, Niggeroes and Niggerenes.

Inamoratas, with an approbation, Bestowed his title. Blessed his inclination. He wakes, unwinds, elaborately: a cat Tawny, reluctant, royal. He is fat And fine this morning. Definite. Reimbursed. He waits a moment, he designs his reign, That no performance may be plain or vain. Then rises in a clear delirium. He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days. And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the Postponed resentments and the prim precautions. Now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender Or take away the power of his pine? What smelly substitute, heady as wine, Would you provide? life must be aromatic. There must be scent, somehow there must be some. Would you have flowers in his life? suggest Asters? a Really Good geranium? A white carnation? would you prescribe a Show With the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum Magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic Red of prize roses? might his happiest Alternative (you muse) be, after all, A bit of gentle garden in the best Of taste and straight tradition? Maybe so. But you forget, or did you ever know, His heritage of cabbage and pigtails, Old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails, Down in the deep (but always beautiful) South Where roses blush their blithest (it is said) And sweet magnolias put Chanel to shame. No! He has not a flower to his name. Except a feather one, for his lapel. Apart from that, if he should think of flowers It is in terms of dandelions or death. Ah, there is little hope. You might as well— Unless you care to set the world a-boil And do a lot of equalizing things, Remove a little ermine, say, from kings, Shake hands with paupers and appoint them men, For instance—certainly you might as well Leave him his lotion, lavender and oil. Let us proceed. Let us inspect, together With his meticulous and serious love, The innards of this closet. Which is a vault Whose glory is not diamonds, not pearls, Not silver plate with just enough dull shine. But wonder-suits in yellow and in wine, Sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt. With shoulder padding that is wide And cocky and determined as his pride; Ballooning pants that taper off to ends Scheduled to choke precisely. Here are hats Like bright umbrellas; and hysterical ties Like narrow banners for some gathering war. People are so in need, in need of help. People want so much that they do not know. Below the tinkling trade of little coins The gold impulse not possible to show Or spend. Promise piled over and betrayed. These kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk. Then they receive the brave and beautiful Embrace of some of that equivocal wool.

Would have him think with horror of baroque, Rococo. You forget and you forget. He dances down the hotel steps that keep Remnants of last night’s high life and distress.

Already I am no longer looked at with lechery or love. My daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls, Are gone from the house. My husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite And night is night. It is a real chill out, The genuine thing. I am not deceived, I do not think it is still summer Because sun stays and birds continue to sing. It is summer-gone that I see, it is summer-gone. The sweet flowers indrying and dying down, The grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown. It is a real chill out. The fall crisp comes. I am aware there is winter to heed. There is no warm house That is fitted with my need. I am cold in this cold house this house Whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls. I am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs. I am a woman who hurries through her prayers. Tin intimations of a quiet core to be my Desert and my dear relief Come: there shall be such islanding from grief, And small communion with the master shore. Twang they. And I incline this ear to tin, Consult a dual dilemma. Whether to dry In humming pallor or to leap and die. Somebody muffed it? Somebody wanted to joke.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The earth is a beautiful place. Watermirrors and things to be reflected. Goldenrod across the little lagoon. The Black Philosopher says “Our chains are in the keep of the Keeper in a labeled cabinet on the second shelf by the cookies, sonatas, the arabesques. . . . There’s a rattle, sometimes. You do not hear it who mind only cookies and crunch them. You do not hear the remarkable music—‘A Death Song For You Before You Die.’ If you could hear it you would make music too. The blackblues.” West Madison Street. In “Jessie’s Kitchen” nobody’s eating Jessie’s Perfect Food. Crazy flowers cry up across the sky, spreading and hissing This is it. The young men run. They will not steal Bing Crosby but will steal Melvin Van Peebles who made Lillie a thing of Zampoughi a thing of red wiggles and trebles (and I know there are twenty wire stalks sticking out of her head as her underfed haunches jerk jazz.) A clean riot is not one in which little rioters long-stomped, long-straddled, BEANLESS but knowing no Why go steal in hell a radio, sit to hear James Brown and Mingus, Young-Holt, Coleman, John on V.O.N. and sun themselves in Sin. However, what is going on is going on. Fire. That is their way of lighting candles in the darkness. A White Philosopher said ‘It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness.’ These candles curse— inverting the deeps of the darkness. GUARD HERE, GUNS LOADED. The young men run. The children in ritual chatter scatter upon their Own and old geography. The Law comes sirening across the town. A woman is dead. Motherwoman. She lies among the boxes (that held the haughty hats, the Polish sausages) in newish, thorough, firm virginity as rich as fudge is if you’ve had five pieces. Not again shall she partake of steak on Christmas mornings, nor of nighttime chicken and wine at Val Gray Ward’s nor say of Mr. Beetley, Exit Jones, Junk Smith nor neat New-baby Williams (man-to-many) “He treat me right.” That was a gut gal. “We’ll do an us!” yells Yancey, a twittering twelve. “Instead of your deathintheafternoon, kill ’em, bull! kill ’em, bull!” The Black Philosopher blares “I tell you, exhaustive black integrity would assure a blackless Amrica. . . .” Nine die, Sun-Times will tell and will tell too in small black-bordered oblongs “Rumor? check it at 744-4111.” A Poem to Peanut. “Coooooool!” purrs Peanut. Peanut is Richard—a Ranger and a gentleman. A Signature. A Herald. And a Span. This Peanut will not let his men explode. And Rico will not. Neither will Sengali. Nor Bop nor Jeff, Geronimo nor Lover. These merely peer and purr, and pass the Passion over. The Disciples stir and thousandfold confer with ranging Rangermen; mutual in their “Yeah!— this AIN’T all upinheah!” “But WHY do These People offend themselves?” say they who say also “It’s time. It’s time to help These People.” Lies are told and legends made. Phoenix rises unafraid. The Black Philosopher will remember: “There they came to life and exulted, the hurt mute. Then is was over. The dust, as they say, settled.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
And if sun comes How shall we greet him? Shall we not dread him, Shall we not fear him After so lengthy a Session with shade?

And if-Monday-never-had-to-come— When you have forgotten that, I say, And how you swore, if somebody beeped the bell, And how my heart played hopscotch if the telephone rang; And how we finally went in to Sunday dinner, That is to say, went across the front room floor to the ink-spotted table in the southwest corner To Sunday dinner, which was always chicken and noodles Or chicken and rice And salad and rye bread and tea And chocolate chip cookies— I say, when you have forgotten that, When you have forgotten my little presentiment That the war would be over before they got to you; And how we finally undressed and whipped out the light and flowed into bed, And lay loose-limbed for a moment in the week-end Bright bedclothes, Then gently folded into each other— When you have, I say, forgotten all that, Then you may tell, Then I may believe You have forgotten me well.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A fatherless child will do almost anything to receive approval from the world. A nod or really any sign of recognition would cause me to put my own life in danger. Once I let my sister lift me on top of both of her extended feet in the middle of the dark of our shared pink and white bedroom. She mimicked a rickety resemblance of Superman her legs locked at the knee and me, dangling in the air both her hands holding tight my wrists. I lie back on the soles of her feet let her kick me up into the night’s jawline. I landed hard against a plank splintered against the edge of our new and exposed steel bed frame. My forearm split itself into a welcome flood blood spilling like a song and I swore I could hear my father sing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

An enormous list: coming and goings, nights and mornings, births and deaths and rebirths and second deaths and little lapses like grace notes where sadness surges in: sadness surges in, a passing-windshield light-effect on the ceiling. Would you prefer it some other way? I’m versatile. I’m hungry. I’m hot. I’m not really sad either. I’m happy, it’s just that this happiness isn’t the happiness I expected or sought and for a time I confused this happiness with the sadness I thought I was experiencing. I feel a lot better now. Oooh. That should give you an indication of the improvement. Oooh, there it goes again. And again, only I didn’t say ‘Oooh’ this time.

The start of a new era Of desperation is starting over. Meanwhile you and your bronze friend Run naked through the yellowed broom sage, Suspended vaporously above life Like high pressure systems. A redolent Cascade of voices from the lawn As the next new hope something will happen Ascends the orangerie steps, an endless Unpunctuated sentence that seems at the time To illuminate everything, as if a giant Had stepped between you and the sun, Sucking the light and punching a hole In space, revealing infinite vistas Of anticipation and delay. These things have no beginning, or rather Were set in motion long before we became Their facsimile, thinking ourselves privileged To secret information, not sensible Of how the world contrives with enormous Duplication of labor to rid itself of us And perform its little routines Solo in the galactic swimming pool That is at last a total stage. It is The amusing notion life might someday Not be confusing that coordinates Our award-winning sentiments these last days Of summer, preparatory to the paint-by-number Rush of autumn, the colors balking Within their lines, which as a kid Was the hardest part and apparently still is. You must do something, though, not caring What it is, so long as when the day ends, You're able to claim that this thing has been accomplished, brought nearer The perfection toward which it ludicrously Aspires, then put aside to be resumed At a point just over the next rise yonder Where suddenly pertinent trees now loom.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Scourging the sea with rods To punish it for what it has engulfed, Or running naked with your bronzed friend Through yellow broom sage: You can't be sure which remedy will be Fatal, or whether the density of the side-effects Will prevent you from moving backwards Across the threshold, to read What the instructions might have said If anyone had taken time to write them down, So we could torture the words, make them Confess their dirty little secret. It's tiered, As earth is, with faults perfectly expressing A gravitational will that we should stumble Over them. And all the hints Get sponged up at night. Above the land fill— Stars, glowing zircon strands of dump truck highbeams Lined up, liquid and radiant, past the last Open-all-night erotica boutique Just over the state line of the last state. Maybe they're the sparks we ignite Rubbing each other the wrong way, fiery notes Unwary rhapsodists pluck from the strings Of incendiary violins. Is that what you think, too? In truth, I prefer your mistaken identity, The upside down one I can see at the back of my eyes Before they flip you into focus, projecting you Across a space at once so vast and so small As not to excite even scientific curiosity. But the light you throw off, out there, Is not enough to see you by. The tapered crimps And ridges, scraped to the wall of the well, Could be any number of people. Try To communicate with the dying sometime And you'll know what I mean. Each one is perfect, Of its kind. Also, all are alike. Not even they Can tell you, though, where the similarities end, Whether it will be any different For you. All I know is that what you are To the waxed, limpid air of freak May in December Or to this room, piled high With genial household archetypes, Is a formal relationship only, as the shape Of an airplane-shaped shrub is To the living plant it's made of. But to me, And all I said and did, and all the time It took me to get here, so much I forgot The purpose of my visit, but kept in anyway; to me, As I hold you, and the messy edges Of our privacy overlap and then withdraw— Think of me as three persons, and as one, But always who I am, ever changing and complete, in the empire of the air Or on the street, or with white sails Stiff against the wind, Whistling far out over the water.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here in Italy the buildings are the color Of dead skin and the sky is “tragic” And the rivers are brown and turbulent And everybody is always stopping by To say “Ciao!” and then “Ciao!” We think a lot about emotion, chiefly The emotion of love. There is much to cry about. And after, sleep. One falls in love So as not to fall asleep. I have just awakened To the fact that I am not in love And am about to fall asleep or write an opera In which someone falls asleep and dies Or write a letter to a friend or call somebody up To meet me later for a drink. Maybe it’s too late. Tomorrow I will go out and buy something to make me happy. I remember standing in the train station in Pisa Hoping to catch the sound of an American voice In the crowd. It’s good to remember such things When you think you haven’t “lived” enough Because you need to learn not to regret What you’ve never done. Fortunately, I remember Everything that's ever happened to me. I remember asking a woman I didn't know Whether or not she was the person I was looking for And she said, “Yes, much to my regret.” That wasn’t difficult to remember Because it just happened a few minutes ago. Other things are harder. I don’t remember Right away what I had for breakfast two weeks ago Last Thursday or the specific date of my first Masturbation, though I’m sure that with some effort I could recover the lasting details. I remember My father using a green hair tonic called “H-A,” Which stood for “Hair Arranger.” I remember the night My father tore out a big clump of my mother's hair In an argument. They were drunk and I came out Of my room in my pajamas and asked them to stop. If I said I wanted to fall apart in someone’s arms You would have to assume I was being sarcastic And you would be right. No one has arms in which I care to fall apart, at least not at the moment. Tomorrow night I am going to see a play about “A contemporary man in the process of falling apart.” I think everyone falls apart about twenty times a day. I’m still confused about why I mentioned Italy At the beginning of this poem, especially since It’s all a terrible lie. My students would say It means “the poet does not know where he is; Some catastrophe has distorted his perceptions.” I am drowsy but happy and resemble the corner Of a big empty room. I am drunk and staring Into the bathtub. A lot of people are standing Around listening to music. My fingers Smell like cigarettes. I am wondering If there is any way to describe the pleasure Someone derives from seeing a man’s cock Shoved up someone’s ass, or how one Can go on like this, even after having given up Completely to nervousness, and to death. I remember the one night I spent on a ship. The porters woke us at dawn. We stood At the railing to sight the blue and transparent island Gaping through mist in the distance. For breakfast, We ate peaches. I hated the people I was with, But I must have been incredibly stupid. We spent the day On the island, seesawed in the park, and waded in the sea.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The table, lamp, and chair strain against the ordinary light that props up the window spilling needles on the carpet, shade recomposing on the sill. Mother wraps her fear into a towel and shrinks upon her bed, denying to the potent afternoon the touch of quick emotions. The engines of the house are still. The stillness is a bullet in her brain. Upon the stake the ivy curls like infant Jesus bloody on the grass. The countertops are polished bright and blue-veined as the mirrors. Clouds stroke the sky into autumn while Mother sleeps and hates the life that hurt her into sleep— bound to one so much not herself, she is his body's inarticulate host. She feels the pillow crease her cheek, uncertain in the ache of waking. No gloss of love dispels the image of those angels she attends, bow-tied detectives who take her away.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Nothing told us it would work out This way, that nothing Stays put in the drawer of itself. Down by the watering can A squirrel is belief, whatever He is thinking. And again, and at The water's edge, and for a long time After summer vacation Pieces of the wreck stabbed the shore Whose revenue of loss engorged The ribboned cone of a shell And played the ear its thousand phrases. But the foreseeable future ended And we are falling backwards Into the view from here that is too bashful To be looked at or taken from a pocket Ingenious as the heart's restive Knowledge of the back of your head. Where were we when a slab of morning Overturned the previous day's verdict Now placed in the evidence against us? I'm still thinking, the kite that that Vertebra of clouds is the tail of, Lifting me up like a number Carried to the top of a column of figures Sheerly by the logic of it As a last-gasp oompah note drains The afternoon of resourcefulness And fear. The cloned minutes pass, Each resembling the original In everything except Not having been predicated on prior Misgivings, merely beguiled Out of the need of space to put Some distance between it And the people who remained behind After departing. Theirs is the sum To be added up, once the Indecipherable messages delivered today Become the sign of how much Waits to be said, in buildings That are torn down and built again And condemned, then raised by night. And every flaw is equalized.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You know me as the lighthousekeeper Knows the weather, at night, on all sides. Sometimes the summer sky is a hollow, dark Socket and I feel as empty as my clothes When I'm not in them. To feel fresh, Like blood from a cut, is best, and to look Up at the stars coming out, like tears Coming out of a face, is also best. Thus each of our gestures amounts To a critique of the whole concept of action. Not one of the spasms of sunlight Splayed across the bed is undeserving Of my attention. We are attached, Painfully, to the individual histories Of these things, which count on us, Like children, to do right by them. I should like to become better acquainted With the facts of your biography, even The uninteresting chapters where you just Lie around all day, smoking cigarettes And thumbing through magazines. The others, Those in which love or lack of love Coils your sympathies to a point of flame, Like sun through a magnifying glass, Consume themselves in their own intensity And seem never to have happened. Humans cannot bear too much unreality: The interlude of splendor, when everything Was on the verge of falling into place And yielding up, at last, its superabundance Of pleasure undiluted by pain or pain From which no particle of pleasure was absent, Must and should give way to afternoons Like these, washed out as an old signature, The negative of dazzling. The voluptuousness Of the act is in the waiting and the not knowing And the wanting and yet not wanting to know The outcome and the hope that the outcome This time will be that there will be no outcome But that time will accommodate itself To a kind of infinite delay in which You are moving forward and not standing still, Yet never approaching or catching sight of, Through waves of distance, whatever's there. If our dreams are unattainable, that is all The more reason to keep on dreaming, As there can be no question of the fully achieved Life or the flawless consummation of anything. And there can be no doubt that the only Immortality is in not dying and not in what I write or do, though I wish you could be there Forever, listening and accepting, as though None of it were really silly or wrongheaded, But somehow beautiful, like the story I heard Once of someone drifting out of a safe harbor, Stunned by a million lights, on the Star Ferry.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Under the trees, where everything Is still possible in prescribed doses: Hundreds of accordion-like units Without edges. But there is no unwinding Of minutes to stay the execution Of a rain-shot weekend in early Beach weather, no elixir To revive the amputated flower Still kicking on its ghost-stem In a bowl of water, no direction In which to steer The hapless, puzzled out-of-towner Other than straight ahead, To the sheer drop-off Where his guidebook gutters Or deposits him, addressless, In thin air.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
At first, we had ways of talking That filled up the evening Until some things could be said. It was a made-up Situation in which lives could be lost. Whatever that was now grows inside Our bodies—a spongy, pulpy cell— Causing pieces of paper we hold In our hands to appear And disappear. All I ask Is to take me away from this place, To another place, very much like This place, where we can meet And six months later Be married. You laughed and went with me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A permanent occasion Knotted into the clouds: pink, then blue, Like a baby holding its breath, or colorless As the gush and pop of conversations Under water.

You want to say, \"Today, the smithereens Must fend for themselves,\" And know the ever-skating decimal's joy, To count on thin ice Growing thinner by degrees, taking its own Sweet time and taking us with it, To navigate magnetic zones in which Intense ecstatic figures touch, like worlds, But don't collide, it being their devotion To depend on you to name for each A proper sphere. \"Today, I turn to silence; Let the language do the talking.\" X the Unknown and his laughable, lovable crew, The tumbling balconies of one-of-us-is-a-robot- And-it's-not-me waves (Spanking a beach so empty If you weren't around to trip me Would I really fall?) and days When the wind is a bridge across our power To enumerate, to dig, to plant, to hold And to communicate the twill-and-tweed- Covered field's coldness Toward our game of enticing it indoors, As if we could erect a rival gate to the departure Whose uniform destination can't surprise, Is blind, speaks not, When on those white and sudden afternoons I take your eyes, and see the sun set twice.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Some people like to relax and kick back with their friends just talking and having a drink which is obviously highly pleasurable. Some people like to be entertained by music or a movie; some people like to make some jokes with people they like, maybe at a bar or at someone’s house. Some people like to lay around with another person, just touching, or to prepare food, alone or with others while listening to music that they feel a particular affinity for. But sometimes people like to thrust themselves into the howling wind and snow, arms tied behind their backs. I prefer to open my mouth wide open knowing what will happen if I’m just holding my mouth open, ready to respond or yell or whatever seems appropriate.

I am wearing dark glasses inside the house To match my dark mood. I have left all the sugar out of the pie. My rage is a kind of domestic rage.

The more words a person knows To describe her private sufferings The more distantly she can perceive them. I repeat the names of all the cities I’ve known And watch an ant drag its crooked shadow home. What does it mean to love the life we’ve been given? To act well the part that’s been cast for us? Wind. Light. Fire. Time. A train whistles through the far hills. One day I plan to be riding it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I was ready for a new experience. All the old ones had burned out. They lay in little ashy heaps along the roadside And blew in drifts across the fairgrounds and fields. From a distance some appeared to be smoldering But when I approached with my hat in my hands They let out small puffs of smoke and expired. Through the windows of houses I saw lives lit up With the otherworldly glow of TV And these were smoking a little bit too. I flew to Rome. I flew to Greece. I sat on a rock in the shade of the Acropolis And conjured dusky columns in the clouds. I watched waves lap the crumbling coast. I heard wind strip the woods. I saw the last living snow leopard Pacing in the dirt. Experience taught me That nothing worth doing is worth doing For the sake of experience alone. I bit into an apple that tasted sweetly of time. The sun came out. It was the old sun With only a few billion years left to shine.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

☽ A Great Book can be read again and again, inexhaustibly, with great benefit to great minds, wrote Mortimer Adler, co-founder of the Great Books Foundation and the Great Books of the Western World program at the university where my husband will be going up for tenure next fall, and where I sometimes teach as well, albeit in a lesser, “non-ladder” position. Not only must a Great Book still matter today, Adler insisted, it must touch upon at least twenty- five of the one hundred and two Great Ideas that have occupied Great Minds for the last twenty-five centuries. Ranging from Angel to World, a comprehensive list of these concepts can be found in Adler’s two-volume Syntopicon: an Index to the Great Ideas, which was published with Great Fanfare, if not Great Financial Success, by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1952. Although the index includes many Great Ideas, including Art, Beauty, Change, Desire, Eternity, Family, Fate, Happiness, History, Pain, Sin, Slavery, Soul, Space, Time, and Truth, it does not, alas, include an entry on Pillows, which often strike me, as I sink into mine at the end of long day of anything, these days, as at the very least worthy of note. Among the five hundred and eleven Great Books on Adler’s list, updated in 1990 to appease his quibbling critics, moreover, only four, I can’t help counting, were written by women—Virginia, Willa, Jane, and George—none of whom, as far as I can discover, were anyone’s mother. ☽ Missing Scenes In which Eve plucks her moustache. In which Achilles waxes his ass. In which a butterfly triggers The Tempest. In which Moby Dick performs his own stunts. In which Bashō smokes hashish. In which the Buddha buys bonds. In which the Heavenly Banquet is served with a spork. In which Galahad chugs from the grail. In which spring follows summer. In which moss grows on meteors. In which Pelé scores on the Peloponnesian Fields. ☽ Not in stock, says the campus bookstore clerk looking up from his screen with a smile when I inquire, incognito, after my books which are nowhere to be found on the shelves. We used to have two copies of the first one, he says, but no one bought them, so we sent them back last June. We never carried the second one, he adds, but we could order it for you. What’s your name? I glance up, above his head, at a shelf of Staff Picks. Between a history of disgust and a guide for saving the planet, I spot my husband’s last book, gleaming in the day’s dying light. Forget it, I mutter into my muffler, I can get it from Amazon by Friday. I go home and order an ivory satin pillowcase instead, guaranteed to reduce hair loss due to breakage and soften fine lines. ☽ No Use Wet cigarettes. E-cigarettes. A babysitter whose babysitter is sick. Nunchucks at a gunfight. Stiletto heels at the beach. Last year’s flu shot. Next year’s peace talks. ☽ Heian courtesans slept lightly, when they slept at all, fully dressed in perfumed robes on straw mats, behind elabroately painted screens upon which their noble visitors knocked softly at all hours. In their onnade “women’s script,” they kept detailed notes about flowers, festivals, and furtive trysts on delicately tinted pages stashed in narrow drawers inside their pillows. These documents, copied and recopied over the centuries by courtiers, monks, and scholars in a relentlessly modernizing Japan, provide readers today with the richest portrait of any culture of its time on the globe. I now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal, reports the nonchalant Shōnagon, and I set about filling the notebooks with odd facts, stories from the past, and all sorts of other things, often including the most trivial material. ☽ All day I lie sprawled across my pillow watching a light crust of snow retract across the lawn into a thin band of shade along the fence. I watch the sun fail to rise above the Japanese maple and drop like a coin into a slot in the wall. ☽ Therapies A to Z Art. Biblio. Chemo. Dung. Electroshock. Family. Gestalt. Hippo. Ichthyo. Jenga.

☽ Not to Be Despised A Hyundai when hitchhiking. Peanuts when traveling coach. Support hose at forty. Dishonorable discharge. Water from a gas-station sink. ☽ For a third day in a row the doorbell rings just as I am finally settling down to do some work. I resolve to settle the matter once and for all. The man on my stoop holds a shovel in one hand and in the other, his hat. An old pillowcse stuffed with something bulky—empty beer cans?—rests on the welcome mat at his feet. For twenty bucks, he offers to clear the front walk. Behind him, snowy steps descend to an icy path winding between a dead hydrangea and the Subaru parked, as usual, a little too close to the fence. My husband, I recall, will not be home until late. The forecast tonight is more snow. I show the man the contents of my wallet—two crumpled fives and one single—which he accepts, bowing slightly. I nod and withdraw behind the locked door. Eleven dollars, I reflect as I return to the keyboard with my tepid kombucha, isn’t bad for a half-hour’s effort. If he works fast, he could be done in twenty minutes. When I take a cupcake break in the kitchen moments later, however, I spy him out the sliding glass door, dragging his shovel behind him down the street, my icy walkway, to all appearances, untouched. Fair enough, I say, jangling my pajama pocket full of loose change. ☽ Pillow is a funny word, Her Majesty announces in the rosy glow of her nightlight. So is Word. She sits up wide-eyed and smiles. Word is a funny word, she repeats. So is Funny! So is Goodnight, I intone from the doorway, and dissolve in the dark. ☽ Guilty Pleasures Beating a child at checkers. Peeing in swimming pools. Watching Dateline. Drinking milk from the carton. Glimpsing one’s neighbor at home in her curlers. Glimpsing one’s neighbor at home in her curlers, watching Dateline, drinking milk from the carton. A roaring fire in July. ☽ Questionable Gestures To haggle with hookers. To roast a bride. Tax-deductible gifts. To supplement a hunger strike with juice. A post-doc at Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Obesity Research sponsored by Pizza Hut. Golden parachutes. Faux fur. Blush on a corpse. ☽ Last night I had a dream so vivid I didn’t bother to record it on my pillow. I was sipping a large stein of sangria at some sort of nightmarish gala, leaning on the arm of a once-powerful older man I’d met in college, upon whom I was now, in the dream, in the awkward position of passing literary judgment. He was wearing a white guayabera shirt with pink stitching, and what hair of his remained was slicked across a forehead speckled with age. I woke angry and aroused and could not get back to sleep. Was this a Prophetic Dream? A Psychological Healing Dream? A Belief Dream? The only option I could rule out for certain was a Dream of Daily Life. ☽ Incongruous A vegan in Vegas. A poor plastic surgeon. Tempests with names like “Trudy” and “Ted.” Perfume at a funeral. Military dolphins. Black balloons. Light rock. ☽ I read a message last night from a woman I have yet to meet beyond the dim glow of a list-serv. She lives in Tampa, if memory serves, and won a juried prize last year for a mixed-media meditation on habitat loss across America, including charts, chants, photographs, oral histories, crowdfunded films, and salvaged trash. She tracks the migratory patterns of purple martins above Wal-Mart parking lots and graphs the spawning grounds of Northern leopard frogs from the Gulf Stream waters to the redwood forests. She posts quarterly reports on her blog. She now finds herself, she confessed last night, in the unfamiliar position of lacking words. While dropping off her child at preschool yesterday, she explained, she learned from a social worker stationed in the foyer about the sudden death, on Wednesday night, of a boy in the class. An accident at home, is all she knows. The details remain undisclosed. The toddlers have been told that ther friend now lives inside their hearts. What does that mean, her daughter wants to know. What does it mean that he@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Little patches of grass disappear In the jaws of lusty squirrels Who slip into the spruce. Cars collapse into parts. Spring dissolves into summer, The kitten into the cat. A tray of drinks departs from the buffet And voilà! the party’s over. All that’s left are some pickles And a sprig of wilting parsley on the rug. When I think of all those Gong-tormented Mesozoic seas I feel a ripple of extinction And blow a smoke ring through the trees. Soon there will be nothing left here but sky.

If you don't get too close to people you can't disappoint them, which would be so much worse than letting them disappoint you. To the extent that you gain a perch that means other people look up to you, to just that extent you can never tell them how you feel. You can warble, or follow a siren, or a Shenandoah vireo, into the shade, or take advice from the lights: be a child, or be like a child. You will want for nothing, and you will never be heard.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It’s like touching without touching, except when there is, also, touching. We pull the bowstrings back and parallel together, aiming a handsbreadth higher than we believe we intend, and let the glove move where we draw the wire, scared that the machinery will misinterpret us, that we may not stop trembling, that we may lose our belief in ourselves before anything is released, or shared, or sent. And yet we trust the notch to know the whereabouts of the bow, and trust the tail or fletching of each salvo to astonish the target as soon as it gets there, to make its point within its nest of Os and Os and Os. Our belts and buckles try to keep the secrets we have begun to decide that, later, we want to expose. There is the rest of our group, and there is the river, and that is called the kisser, the stabilizer on your shoulder. Do what I do. You have time. Put your hand over my hand. That feels nice. No longer too young to participate in this activity, we have become the elevated counselors of the air, which will not take anything but our most forceful advice.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They tilt their guitars and stare. Each boy puts one foot toward Us, one where a trailing wire Would run to an amplifier If amplifiers were there. Bill's Gibson glitters like ore. Kenny's Ibañez hoards White noise in its black fretboard. Bill's double chin shows. Is it fair To mention his pudge? Kenny's hair Gets stuck behind one ear. Each of the brothers wears A T-shirt, loose jeans, and a pair Of bruised high-tops. A pear- Shaped garbage bag hugs a steel bar. The big rectangular blur Behind them looks like the door To a walk-in refrigerator. Maybe dad is a restaurateur, A diner owner who requires Kenny to spend six hours A week moving cases of beer, While Bill chops potatoes, or scours Grease from the checkerboard floor.

A real one wouldn't need one, but the one Nathan draws surely does: four oblongs the size and color of popsicles, green apple, toasted coconut and grape, flanked, two per side, by billowing valentine hearts, in a frame of Scotch tape. Alive, it could stay off the floor, for a few unaerodynamic minutes; thrown as a paper airplane, for one or two more. Very sensibly, therefore, our son gave it something, not to keep it apart from the ground forever, but rather to make safe its descent.

I can remember when I wanted X more than anything ever—for X fill in from your own childhood [balloon, pencil lead, trading card, shoelaces, a bow or not to have to wear a bow] and now I am moved to action, when I am moved, principally by a memory of what to want. The point is to be, in your own eyes, what you are, or to keep your own tools, so that you can pretend. And so it was no surprise, to me at least, when Cooper, who is two, collapsed in fortissimo fits when he could not have a $20, three-foot-long stuffed frog in the image of Frog from Frog and Toad, since he is Toad. That morning, needing a nap, he had thrown, from the third-story balcony of Miller's Cafe and Bakery, into the whistling rapids and shallows of the Ammonoosuc River, with its arrowheads and caravans of stones, his Red Sox cap. His hair was shining like another planet's second sun, as he explained, looking up, \"I threw my hat in the river. I would like my hat back now.\"@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 I made myself. Mommy and Daddy were proud, in that order. I didn’t mail myself like a letter some other kids already knew. I learned to use stamps. They stuck to my thumb without any glue. I didn’t have any permission. 2 There was a snowstorm that lasted three days and a cavern of monochrome memory. There were board games, and a pencil-and-paper game where the object was to figure out the object of the game. There was a stack of broad-rule writing paper, and a stapled calendar, and a 64-pack of sparkly rainbow crayons, to make each week look different since they all started out black and white, and all the same. 3 O grapefruit (as color and flavor). O never quite rightly tied laces. O look, up there on the uneven climbing bars, too hot to touch where the sun touches, now that it’s spring, the shadow of a tarp, like a sail between sailors and thin swings that make no decision, like weathervanes.

We have had our lives. The reservoir visible In the window beside our elbows, and the willow Branches trailing at our stop Are the nature we leave Behind us gladly, since it has no place For all we have recently learned: that sex Is temporary, help Ours to hand down now, and materials science Not the only kind. We thank Calm, careful Minerva, goddess Of adults, who for so many years took us To school: her voice the timbre of fretless bass, Her eyes the color of pencil lead, she taught Us how to behave in order to have our rewards In twenty years. We have them, and if we wish Too often, this fall, to have led another life We do not mean that we would give up ours: Though we stand in a row and sway Before an obstructed view, we are able to find Initials outlined in the crosshatched trees, And pebbles—calculi—around our ponds And cherish them; we like to watch the roads Along which the perennial pollen sifts down As finely as ever, making a soft powder Of brass amid the troughs in softball fields.

By way of my mother, the deacon with the slick gray hair and money clip in his pocket can claim a percentage of my body like tithe rights. And on this Sunday, as with every other Sunday, he is a slender ebony panel in the fence of faith, one man in the company of men standing shoulder to shoulder in suits, tapping their toes, clapping their hands, putting muscle to work in the making of praise music. We Baptists call this devotion, my working definition of which is faithfulness to the light. To the extent that God is as white as the clouds of heaven, this theory holds. To the extent these particular men are dark, I must consider other possibilities: that God remade himself in my image so that we could be closer or that devotion means the commitment of black men to stand with one another, form a barricade of soldiers against anything as necessary, the Lord being the force holding them fast in line. It isn’t always easy for me to see these explanations as separate: any film, any photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. leading a march, with his position centered in a line of bodies covering the entire width of the frame — if I take a wide view of that scene, I see the Lord at work. If I zoom in, on a single person or the breach between two, I see no trace of the Lord at all, a hint that He can’t exist in small spaces. And what’s more, consider this: say Chicago PD pulls a long line of youths into the precinct for photographs — all of them dark, all of them wearing the same colors — and stands them shoulder to shoulder. Zoom in: nothing. Zoom out: the Lord? Why not? There’s clearly commitment there, devotion. They’re all definitely soldiers, on the battlefield for something: maybe it’s white, maybe it’s green, maybe it’s a colorless feeling. I’ve got no good answers, only darkness. I’m still trying to decipher if it means anything that Dr. King lived in Vice Lords territory when he spent ’66 in Chicago, that the words “vice” and “Lord” are affiliates, homeboys, next-door neighbors. I think about their coming up together in the mind of a boy living on that side of town, a percentage of his body, perhaps, claimed as a tax; I can’t shake this feeling that when he throws his muscles into praise music, when sound leaves his precious mouth, people scatter. I can’t help but believe our songs, to one another, would be familiar, church family: I am on the battlefield for my Lord I’m on the battlefield for my Lord and I promised Him that I would serve Him till I die till I die, till I die, till I die@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tell me how you entered this poem, how you even got in here. Where my parentals come from is where I’m coming from and where where I’m coming from is from we lock the front door and the back and the side and can’t spare a single extra key. Wherewhere I’m coming from is from we shut all the windows tight like our eyes to an ugly view: a jail if I ever saw one, and maybe I did, and maybe that was enough for me. Maybe you made the mistake, by coming here. Unannounced. Uninvited. It takes a lot of talent to step in someone’s crib and be welcomed without any alarms going off, so shake your ass something dangerous if you can, sing me a song real sexy-like or be suck out of luck if I feel like shooting strangers today. If home is where the heart is then four red bullet wounds across the chest of the city’s flag say everything there is about my feelings toward you and the whole damn world right now. Because it was my own blood this time and yet I’m still here, and the funny thing about that town and this one is that they both burned down once. And down the hall they’re burning bud and I want some kinda sorta but without the friends. Which makes you foe, I suppose, as if you are the presence of all colors and I am the absence of said colors. But maybe I got it backwards, twisted it all up. It just hurts to have my hair pulled even if it’s by my own hand. My mind is spinning blanks inside every chamber; everywhere I turn on the TV they’re shooting boys like what I used to be before I wasn’t anymore and when did that happen? And what am I now? Are you the phantom or me, me or none of the above? The last shadow I cast on a sunny Sunday stole my wallet and bought this gun and all the rounds and all the rounds at the bar, too. Where I’m coming from, when in love: squeeze. When lonely, loan yourself some time and don’t pay it back. Beware, because I’m both lonely and in love like the living embodiment of the code switch. I’m polluted air and poisoned water and whatever else they say except when I say I’m not and I’m not one to play for a fool for the record. Fear me. I’m godly and I’m just and just get the hell out demon and do come again. Come again: it’s my igneous ire toward you that keeps me a live wire, and alive.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Muscular as a stallion in fact — but I have no horse in this race of people against people. It was made certain I wouldn’t, that I’d inherit nothing except a whipping of my hindquarters as a form of correction, in the cadence of I love you, tar baby, I love you. This is not unlike how my parents were raised, to comply, and their parents before them, and theirs before them and so forth as far back as anyone cared to speak of what they lived through, the preposterous preposition of it all. Therefore and thereafter, whenever I hear the word pedigree, I think of the blank check I don’t have behind my name, and then I think of saddles and stirrups, and then the soreness of my lower back, and then the source of that. How a boss can ride you: of this I am personally familiar, plus know by blood drawn from two lines of family men forced to cut out their own tongues to keep food on the table they could no longer taste or even stand to. Their tongues grew back, yes, after some time and with sharpness I’m told, needing to cut against something, anything, to be purposeful given their new forms.Woe! Woe! Woe! How a man rides his wife, his children, how he’d ride a horse he’ll never have, could never give them unless said horse is immaterial, hence not a horse at all — just muscular, as a stallion is, as a word is that’s denied striving families horsepower, any engine beyond their fragile bodies to propel them forward; the whole race: forward, even if it pits people against a people, even if it means rearing a rear end tender and raw. I love you, tar baby, I love you something strong.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
what she told me. What I honor. They, as unambiguous as Lyrae is: black, bard, badass; svelte with flourishing braids; a singularity and somehow all of them gathered as one like tributaries to the mouth of the river of God—Gwendolyn and Lucille and June and—and I can’t count all the ways I was saved that day, emerging wet from the ritual to find myself sitting in some stranger’s living room, a writer who’d been pushed out of their homeland by its persecutions, pulled into America on the promise of asylum, the same America that commits my own kind to institutions with routine and rarely second thoughts signaling the presence of conscience, and while we’re on the subject of right and wrong, know I’d read the news recently and retreated far into my unfeeling before I received the blessing of her timely word, walking in bloody boots through hallways leading to the chambers where tenderness is said to rest in all of us by symbology, but then I was called outside my bones again. And let me tell you, my friend: you’ve never seen light before you’ve seen it. I swear, it’s as if with the snap of a finger I could recite the very definition of gold without needing to run yolk from the promise of a child, a happy day’s glow spilling into the street like July’s laughter from a fire hydrant as we left the house with folk who loved words and loved us—loved us— so expansively. And less than two nights later we’re all throwing our asses in a circle, cuttin’ up, working up what was an effortless sweat, undeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying wires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying to catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind—no, I wasn’t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is to death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously—the sub and the synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of their chests and the fall—and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after- burn of Hennessy, but yo, it’s like I was being called for, called out of need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world where we ain’t free. And, nah, we ain’t free, if you were wondering. There are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can’t feel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence of civil war, a set of chimeless chains that could be yanked on and bring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens— again—I suppose I could pray, there, at my literally lowest moment, immersed in the mess they’ve made that I’m tasked with cleaning up for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don’t get shot while genuflect since that’s apparently a thing now in this country, but I worry such a selfish ask won’t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven, that the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily as tissue paper. And I recognize I’m rambling now, but I’m likewise increasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside the milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it’s hard to translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it’s hard to relate to folk who don’t consider their own demise fifty ’leven times a day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but an itch of practicality. What I wouldn’t pay for the chance to not pay attention to every little thing—how they talk near me and how they talk when they believe I’m nowhere near, what they do or don’t do with each other that they do or don’t do with me, the questions they feel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though I leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them so well, people who wouldn’t know me from the next in the lineup; I know them so intimately you’d think I love them all, and the gag is that I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too. To say they don’t deserve@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them: a loaded word of bond with dress codes and penal codes, postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags from knots tied on the backs of head wraps worn hoods over. I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way, with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two tracks while a circus of peers clowned. Going back far too long now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion even if I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan. I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good; a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow. I had to break it down for myself that being down represented the fear of having fear. I still shake when the wind blows, scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me, through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate— a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the position of silence like rusty nails. If carrying nothing else, I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue, strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say, since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil used as sitcom trope. Just imagine the person coming for you being you every time: don’t trip, you’d say, unless into the fight.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
is surely a peculiar answer for any teacher to receive when asking a kindergartner, but on second take, what word best describes me, crossbreed of butterfly and Super Fly aesthetics, other than peculiar? I suppose calling me a keen kid would also suffice in explaining my avidity for the kind of death that progresses the narrative of a gentling history, because that’s the only frame for greatness I seem to find for boys my shade and age to aspire to, short of having the height and hops to touch the rim, or the bulk and burst to break through the defensive line like a bullet.And, no, I haven’t given up on the prospect of Bulls starting shooting guard yet, but the God-fearer impressed upon me begs the mythology of goodness delivered to the multitudes like loaves and fish;how King is talked about in a black Christian tradition stillin mourning over his lost rays of light, the way mentioningthe name of Malcolm makes mice of shady white men some thirty years after the shotgun and he’s sung of as a prince: I want to evoke that level of pride in American democracy’s dark downtrodden because I know what it invokes in me, young and impressionable, watching Denzel’s mimicry for the one millionth time in my abbreviated existence — drawing an X on my undeveloped chest, pushing it out into the unknown-ahead hoping a Mecca for melanin rises from the man-shaped hole I’d left in my loved ones’ lives.I bet my parents would be so proud of me. I bet post offices would close on my birthday. I bet God would dap me upwhen I got up there and Jesus — dying on a cross to meet me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Bifil that in that seson on a day, In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay, Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage To Caunterbury with ful devout corage, At nyght were come into that hostelrye Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye Of sondry folk, by áventure y-falle In felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they alle, That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde.

In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye. At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye, Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See At many a noble armee hadde he be. At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene, And foughten for oure feith at Tramyssene In lyste thries, and ay slayn his foo. This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also Somtyme with the lord of Palatye Agayn another hethen in Turkye; And evermoore he hadde a sovereyn prys. And though that he were worthy, he was wys, And of his port as meeke as is a mayde. He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde, In al his lyf, unto no maner wight. He was a verray, parfit, gentil knyght. But for to tellen yow of his array, His hors weren goode, but he was nat gay; Of fustian he wered a gypon Al bismótered with his habergeon; For he was late y-come from his viage, And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.

And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie, And born hym weel, as of so litel space, In hope to stonden in his lady grace. Embrouded was he, as it were a meede Al ful of fresshe floures whyte and reede. Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day; He was as fressh as is the month of May.

And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede With newe grene, of lusty Veer the pryme, And swote smellen floures white and rede, In sondry wises shewed, as I rede, The folk of Troie hir observaunces olde, Palladiones feste for to holde. And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse, In general ther wente many a wight, To herknen of Palladion the servyse; And namely, so many a lusty knyght, So many a lady fressh and mayden bright, Ful wel arayed, both meste, mene, and leste, Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste. Among thise othere folk was Criseyda, In widewes habit blak; but natheles, Right as our firste lettre is now an A, In beautee first so stood she, makeles; Hire goodly lokyng gladed al the prees. Nas nevere yet seyn thing to ben preysed derre, Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichone That hir bihelden in hir blake wede; And yet she stood ful lowe and stille allone, Byhynden other folk, in litel brede, And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede, Simple of atir and debonaire of chere, With ful assured lokyng and manere. This Troilus, as he was wont to gide His yonge knyghtes, lad hem up and doun In thilke large temple on every side, Byholding ay the ladies of the town, Now here, now there; for no devoc{.i}@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
With this he took his leve, and hom he wente; And lord, so he was glad and wel bygon! Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente, But streght in-to hire closet wente anon, And set hire doun as stylle as any ston, And every word gan up and doun to wynde, That he hadde seyd, as it com hire to mynde; And wex somdel aston ed in hire thought, Right for the newe cas; but whan that she Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought Of peril, why she ought afered be, For man may love, of possibilite, A womman so, his herte may to-breste, And she naught love ayein, but-if hire leste. But as she sat allone and thought e thus, Ascry aroos at scarmuch al with-oute, And men cryde in the strete, \"Se, Troilus Hath right now put to flighte the Grekes route!\" With that gan al hire meynee for to shoute, \"A! go we see; caste up the latis wyde; For thorugh this strete he moot to paleys ryde; \"For other wey is fro the yat e noon Of Dardanus, ther opyn is the cheyne.\" With that com he and al his folk anoon An esy pas rydynge, in routes tweyne, Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne, For which, men seyn, may nought distourbed be That shal bityden of necessitee. This Troilus sat on his bay e steede, Al armed, save his hed, ful richely, And wownded was his hors, and gan to blede, On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely, But swych a knyghtly sighte, trewely, As was on hym was nought, withouten faille, To loke on Mars, that god is of bataille. So lik a man of arm es and a knyght He was to seen, fulfilled of heigh prowesse; For bothe he hadde a body and a myght To doon that thing, as wel as hardynesse; And eek to seen hym in his gere hym dresse, So fressh, so yong, so weldy semed he, It was an heven up-on hym for to see. His helm to-hewen was in twenty places, That by a tyssew heng, his bak byhynde; His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces, In which men myghte many an arwe fyndeThat thirl ed hadde horn and nerf and rynde; And ay the peple cryde, \"Here cometh oure joye, And, next his brother, holder up of Troye!\" For which he wex a litel reed for shame, Whan he the peple up-on hym herde cryen, That to byholde it was a noble game, How sobreliche he caste doun his ÿen. Cryseÿda gan al his chere aspien, And leet it so softe yn hir herte synke, That to hireself she seyde, \"Who yaf me drynke?\" For of hire owen thought she wex al reed, Remembryng hire right thus, \"Lo, this is he Which that myn uncle swerith he moot be deed, But I on hym have mercy and pitee.\" And with that thought, for pure ashamed, she Gan in hir hed to pulle, and that as faste, Whil he and all the peple forby paste. And gan to caste and rollen up and doun With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse, And his estat, and also his renown, His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse; But moost hir favour was, for his distresseWas al for hire, and thoughte it was a routheTo sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe. Now myghte som envious jangle thus: \"This was a sodeyn love; how myght it be That she so lightly loved Troilus Right for the firste syghte; ye, pardee?\" Now who-so seith so, mote he never thee! For everything, a gynnyng hath it nedeEr al be wrought, with-outen any drede. For I sey nought that she so sodeynly Yaf hym hire love, but that she gan enclyneTo like him first, and I have told yow whi; And after that, his manhod and his pyneMade love with-inne hire herte for to myne, For which, by proces and by good servyse, He gat hire love, and in no sodeyn wyse.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The morwen com, and gostly for to speke, This Diomede is come un-to Criseyde; And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke, So wel he for hym-selven spak and seyde, That alle hire sikes soore adown he leyde. And finaly, the sothe for to seyne, He refte hir of the grete of al hire peyne. And after this the storie telleth us That she hym yaf the fair e baye stede, The which he ones wan of Troilus; And ek a broche (and that was litel nede) That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede. And ek, the bet from sorwe him to releve, She made hym were a pencel of hire sleve. I fynde ek in the stories ell es-where, Whan thorugh the body hurt was DiomedeOf Troilus, tho wepte she many a teer e, Whan that she saugh his wyde wowndes blede; And that she took, to kepen hym, good hede; And for to hele hym of his sorwes smerte, Men seyn, I not, that she yaf hym hire herte. But trew ely, the storie telleth us, Ther made nevere woman moore wo Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus. She seyde, \"Allas! for now is clene a-go My name of trouthe in love, for evere-mo! For I have falsed oon the gentilesteThat ever e was, and oon the worthieste! \"Allas, of me, un-to the world es ende, Shal neyther been y-writen nor y-songeNo good word, for thise bok es wol me shende.

And, trewely, I wolde sory be For to seen yow in adversitee. And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve; But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.\" But trew ely, how longe it was bytwene, That she forsok him for this Diomede, Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene.

A bird flew out at the break of day From the nest where it had curled, And ere the eve the bird had set Fear on the kings of the world. The first tree it lit upon Was green with leaves unshed; The second tree it lit upon Was red with apples red; The third tree it lit upon Was barren and was brown, Save for a dead man nailed thereon On a hill above a town. That night the kings of the earth were gay And filled the cup and can; Last night the kings of the earth were chill For dread of a naked man. ‘If he speak two more words,’ they said, ‘The slave is more than the free; If he speak three more words,’ they said, ‘The stars are under the sea.’ Said the King of the East to the King of the West, I wot his frown was set, ‘Lo, let us slay him and make him as dung, It is well that the world forget.’ Said the King of the West to the King of the East, I wot his smile was dread, ‘Nay, let us slay him and make him a god, It is well that our god be dead.’ They set the young man on a hill, They nailed him to a rod; And there in darkness and in blood They made themselves a god. And the mightiest word was left unsaid, And the world had never a mark, And the strongest man of the sons of men Went dumb into the dark. Then hymns and harps of praise they brought, Incense and gold and myrrh, And they thronged above the seraphim, The poor dead carpenter. ‘Thou art the prince of all,’ they sang, ‘Ocean and earth and air.’ Then the bird flew on to the cruel cross, And hid in the dead man’s hair. ‘Thou art the son of the world.’ they cried, ` ‘Speak if our prayers be heard.’ And the brown bird stirred in the dead man’s hair And it seemed that the dead man stirred. Then a shriek went up like the world’s last cry From all nations under heaven, And a master fell before a slave And begged to be forgiven. They cowered, for dread in his wakened eyes The ancient wrath to see; And a bird flew out of the dead Christ’s hair, And lit on a lemon tree.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
After one moment when I bowed my head And the whole world turned over and came upright, And I came out where the old road shone white. I walked the ways and heard what all men said, Forests of tongues, like autumn leaves unshed, Being not unlovable but strange and light; Old riddles and new creeds, not in despite But softly, as men smile about the dead The sages have a hundred maps to give That trace their crawling cosmos like a tree, They rattle reason out through many a sieve That stores the sand and lets the gold go free: And all these things are less than dust to me Because my name is Lazarus and I live.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A mountainous and mystic brute No rein can curb, no arrow shoot, Upon whose doomed deformed back I sweep the planets’ scorching track. Old is the elf, and wise, men say, His hair grows green as ours grows grey; He mocks the stars with myriad hands, High as that swinging forest stands. But though in pigmy wanderings dull I scour the deserts of his skull, I never find the face, eyes, teeth, Lowering or laughing underneath. I met my foe in an empty dell, His face in the sun was naked hell. I thought, ‘One silent, bloody blow, No priest would curse, no crowd would know.’ Then cowered: a daisy, half concealed, Watched for the fame of that poor field; And in that flower and suddenly Earth opened its one eye on me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When fishes flew and forests walked And figs grew upon thorn, Some moment when the moon was blood Then surely I was born. With monstrous head and sickening cry And ears like errant wings, The devil’s walking parody On all four-footed things. The tattered outlaw of the earth, Of ancient crooked will; Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb, I keep my secret still. Fools! For I also had my hour; One far fierce hour and sweet: There was a shout about my ears, And palms before my feet.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The men that worked for England They have their graves at home: And birds and bees of England About the cross can roam. But they that fought for England, Following a falling star, Alas, alas for England They have their graves afar. And they that rule in England, In stately conclave met, Alas, alas for England They have no graves as yet.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The hucksters haggle in the mart The cars and carts go by; Senates and schools go droning on; For dead things cannot die. A storm stooped on the place of tombs With bolts to blast and rive; But these be names of many men The lightning found alive. If usurers rule and rights decay And visions view once more Great Carthage like a golden shell Gape hollow on the shore, Still to the last of crumbling time Upon this stone be read How many men of England died To prove they were not dead.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
White founts falling in the courts of the sun, And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run; There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared, It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard, It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips, For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships. They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy, They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea, And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss, And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross, The cold queen of England is looking in the glass; The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass; From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun, And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun. Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard, Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred, Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall, The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall, The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung, That once went singing southward when all the world was young, In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid, Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade. Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far, Don John of Austria is going to the war, Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold, Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums, Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes. Don John laughing in the brave beard curled, Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world, Holding his head up for a flag of all the free. Love-light of Spain—hurrah! Death-light of Africa! Don John of Austria Is riding to the sea. Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star, (Don John of Austria is going to the war.) He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri’s knees, His turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas. He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease, And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees, And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing. Giants and the Genii, Multiplex of wing and eye, Whose strong obedience broke the sky When Solomon was king. They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn, From temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn; They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be; On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl, Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl; They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,— They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound. And he saith, “Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide, And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide, And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest, For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west. We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun, Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done, But a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know The voice that shook our palaces—four hundred years ago: It is he that saith not ‘Kismet’; it is he that knows not Fate ; It is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey in the gate! It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth, Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth.” For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar, (Don John of Austria is going to the war.) Sudden and still—hurrah! Bolt from Iberia! Don John of Austria Is gone by Alcalar. St. Michael’s on his mountain in the sea-roads of the north (Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.) Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift And the sea folk labour and the red sails lift. He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone; The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I cut a staff in a churchyard copse, I clad myself in ragged things, I set a feather in my cap That fell out of an angel’s wings. I filled my wallet with white stones, I took three foxgloves in my hand, I slung my shoes across my back, And so I went to fairyland. But lo, within that ancient place Science had reared her iron crown, And the great cloud of steam went up That telleth where she takes a town. But cowled with smoke and starred with lamps, That strange land’s light was still its own; The word that witched the woods and hills Spoke in the iron and the stone. Not Nature’s hand had ever curved That mute unearthly porter’s spine. Like sleeping dragon’s sudden eyes The signals leered along the line. The chimneys thronging crooked or straight Were fingers signalling the sky; The dog that strayed across the street Seemed four-legged by monstrosity. ‘In vain,’ I cried, ‘though you too touch The new time’s desecrating hand, Through all the noises of a town I hear the heart of fairyland.’ I read the name above a door, Then through my spirit pealed and passed: ‘This is the town of thine own home, And thou hast looked on it at last.’@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode, The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road. A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire, And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire; A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head. I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire, And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire; But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made, Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands, The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands. His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun? The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which, But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch. God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier. My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage, Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age, But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth, And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death; For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen, Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The thistledown's flying, though the winds are all still, On the green grass now lying, now mounting the hill, The spring from the fountain now boils like a pot; Through stones past the counting it bubbles red-hot. The ground parched and cracked is like overbaked bread, The greensward all wracked is, bents dried up and dead. The fallow fields glitter like water indeed, And gossamers twitter, flung from weed unto weed. Hill-tops like hot iron glitter bright in the sun, And the rivers we're eying burn to gold as they run; Burning hot is the ground, liquid gold is the air; Whoever looks round sees Eternity there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He could not die when trees were green, For he loved the time too well. His little hands, when flowers were seen, Were held for the bluebell, As he was carried o'er the green. His eye glanced at the white-nosed bee; He knew those children of the spring: When he was well and on the lea He held one in his hands to sing, Which filled his heart with glee. Infants, the children of the spring! How can an infant die When butterflies are on the wing, Green grass, and such a sky? How can they die at spring? He held his hands for daisies white, And then for violets blue, And took them all to bed at night That in the green fields grew, As childhood's sweet delight. And then he shut his little eyes, And flowers would notice not; Birds' nests and eggs caused no surprise, He now no blossoms got; They met with plaintive sighs. When winter came and blasts did sigh, And bare were plain and tree, As he for ease in bed did lie His soul seemed with the free, He died so quietly.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I ne’er was struck before that hour With love so sudden and so sweet, Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower And stole my heart away complete. My face turned pale as deadly pale, My legs refused to walk away, And when she looked, what could I ail? My life and all seemed turned to clay. And then my blood rushed to my face And took my eyesight quite away, The trees and bushes round the place Seemed midnight at noonday. I could not see a single thing, Words from my eyes did start— They spoke as chords do from the string, And blood burnt round my heart. Are flowers the winter’s choice? Is love’s bed always snow? She seemed to hear my silent voice, Not love's appeals to know. I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before. My heart has left its dwelling-place And can return no more.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I am—yet what I am none cares or knows; My friends forsake me like a memory lost: I am the self-consumer of my woes— They rise and vanish in oblivious host, Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed Into the nothingness of scorn and noise, Into the living sea of waking dreams, Where there is neither sense of life or joys, But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems; Even the dearest that I loved the best Are strange—nay, rather, stranger than the rest. I long for scenes where man hath never trod A place where woman never smiled or wept There to abide with my Creator, God, And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept, Untroubling and untroubled where I lie The grass below—above the vaulted sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I hid my love when young till I Couldn't bear the buzzing of a fly; I hid my love to my despite Till I could not bear to look at light: I dare not gaze upon her face But left her memory in each place; Where'er I saw a wild flower lie I kissed and bade my love good-bye. I met her in the greenest dells, Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells; The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye, The bee kissed and went singing by, A sunbeam found a passage there, A gold chain round her neck so fair; As secret as the wild bee's song She lay there all the summer long. I hid my love in field and town Till e'en the breeze would knock me down; The bees seemed singing ballads o'er, The fly's bass turned a lion's roar; And even silence found a tongue, To haunt me all the summer long; The riddle nature could not prove Was nothing else but secret love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Love lives beyond The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew— I love the fond, The faithful, and the true Love lives in sleep, 'Tis happiness of healthy dreams Eve’s dews may weep, But love delightful seems. 'Tis seen in flowers, And in the even's pearly dew On earth's green hours, And in the heaven's eternal blue. ‘Tis heard in spring When light and sunbeams, warm and kind, On angels’ wing Bring love and music to the wind. And where is voice, So young, so beautiful and sweet As nature’s choice, Where Spring and lovers meet? Love lives beyond The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew. I love the fond, The faithful, young and true.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Love, meet me in the green glen, Beside the tall elm-tree, Where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen; There come with me. Meet me in the green glen. Meet me at the sunset Down in the green glen, Where we’ve often met By hawthorn-tree and foxes’ den, Meet me in the green glen. Meet me in the green glen, By sweetbriar bushes there; Meet me by your own sen, Where the wild thyme blossoms fair. Meet me in the green glen. Meet me by the sweetbriar, By the mole-hill swelling there; When the west glows like a fire God’s crimson bed is there. Meet me in the green glen.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The rolls and harrows lie at rest beside The battered road; and spreading far and wide Above the russet clods, the corn is seen Sprouting its spiry points of tender green, Where squats the hare, to terrors wide awake, Like some brown clod the harrows failed to break. Opening their golden caskets to the sun, The buttercups make schoolboys eager run, To see who shall be first to pluck the prize— Up from their hurry, see, the skylark flies, And o'er her half-formed nest, with happy wings Winnows the air, till in the cloud she sings, Then hangs a dust-spot in the sunny skies, And drops, and drops, till in her nest she lies, Which they unheeded passed—not dreaming then That birds which flew so high would drop agen To nests upon the ground, which anything May come at to destroy. Had they the wing Like such a bird, themselves would be too proud, And build on nothing but a passing cloud! As free from danger as the heavens are free From pain and toil, there would they build and be, And sail about the world to scenes unheard Of and unseen—Oh, were they but a bird!

Come we to the summer, to the summer we will come, For the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom, And the crow is on the oak a-building of her nest, And love is burning diamonds in my true lover's breast; She sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her hair, And I will to my true lover with a fond request repair; I will look upon her face, I will in her beauty rest, And lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast. The clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of May, The merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day, And the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest In the whitethorn bush where I will lean upon my lover's breast; I'll lean upon her breast and I'll whisper in her ear That I cannot get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my dear; I hunger at my meat and I daily fade away Like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Now swarthy Summer, by rude health embrowned, Precedence takes of rosy fingered Spring; And laughing Joy, with wild flowers prank'd, and crown'd, A wild and giddy thing, And Health robust, from every care unbound, Come on the zephyr's wing, And cheer the toiling clown. Happy as holiday-enjoying face, Loud tongued, and \"merry as a marriage bell,\" Thy lightsome step sheds joy in every place; And where the troubled dwell, Thy witching charms wean them of half their cares; And from thy sunny spell, They greet joy unawares. Then with thy sultry locks all loose and rude, And mantle laced with gems of garish light, Come as of wont; for I would fain intrude, And in the world's despite, Share the rude wealth that thy own heart beguiles; If haply so I might Win pleasure from thy smiles. Me not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers, In nightly revels or in city streets; But joys which soothe, and not distract the ears, That one at leisure meets In the green woods, and meadows summer-shorn, Or fields, where bee-fly greets The ear with mellow horn. The green-swathed grasshopper, on treble pipe, Sings there, and dances, in mad-hearted pranks; There bees go courting every flower that's ripe, On baulks and sunny banks; And droning dragon-fly, on rude bassoon, Attempts to give God thanks In no discordant tune. The speckled thrush, by self-delight embued, There sings unto himself for joy's amends, And drinks the honey dew of solitude. There Happiness attends With inbred Joy until the heart o'erflow, Of which the world's rude friends, Nought heeding, nothing know. There the gay river, laughing as it goes, Plashes with easy wave its flaggy sides, And to the calm of heart, in calmness shows What pleasure there abides, To trace its sedgy banks, from trouble free: Spots Solitude provides To muse, and happy be. There ruminating 'neath some pleasant bush, On sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine ease, Where I can pillow on the yielding rush; And, acting as I please, Drop into pleasant dreams; or musing lie, Mark the wind-shaken trees, And cloud-betravelled sky. There think me how some barter joy for care, And waste life's summer-health in riot rude, Of nature, nor of nature's sweets aware. When passions vain intrude, These, by calm musings, softened are and still; And the heart's better mood Feels sick of doing ill. There I can live, and at my leisure seek Joys far from cold restraints—not fearing pride— Free as the winds, that breathe upon my cheek Rude health, so long denied. Here poor Integrity can sit at ease, And list self-satisfied The song of honey-bees. The green lane now I traverse, where it goes Nought guessing, till some sudden turn espies Rude batter'd finger post, that stooping shows Where the snug mystery lies; And then a mossy spire, with ivy crown, Cheers up the short surprise, And shows a peeping town. I see the wild flowers, in their summer morn Of beauty, feeding on joy's luscious hours; The gay convolvulus, wreathing round the thorn, Agape for honey showers; And slender kingcup, burnished with the dew Of morning's early hours, Like gold yminted new. And mark by rustic bridge, o'er shallow stream, Cow-tending boy, to toil unreconciled, Absorbed as in some vagrant summer dream; Who now, in gestures wild, Starts dancing to his shadow on the wall, Feeling self-gratified, Nor fearing human thrall. Or thread the sunny valley laced with streams, Or forests rude, and the o'ershadow'd brims Of simple ponds, where idle shepherd dreams, Stretching his listless limbs; Or trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long, Where joy's wild impulse swims In one continued song. I love at early morn, from new mown swath, To see the startled frog his route pursue; To mark while, leaping o'er the dripping path, His bright sides scatter dew, The early lark that from its bustle flies, To hail his matin new; And watch him to the skies. To note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent, The jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn, With earnest heed, and tremulous intent, Frail brother of the morn, That from the tiny bent's dew-misted leaves Withdraws his@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Well, honest John, how fare you now at home? The spring is come, and birds are building nests; The old cock-robin to the sty is come, With olive feathers and its ruddy breast; And the old cock, with wattles and red comb, Struts with the hens, and seems to like some best, Then crows, and looks about for little crumbs, Swept out by little folks an hour ago; The pigs sleep in the sty; the bookman comes— The little boy lets home-close nesting go, And pockets tops and taws, where daisies blow, To look at the new number just laid down, With lots of pictures, and good stories too, And Jack the Giant-killer's high renown.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
And what is Life?—An hour-glass on the run, A Mist retreating from the morning sun, A busy, bustling, still repeated dream; Its length?—A minute's pause, a moment's thought; And happiness?—A bubble on the stream, That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought. What are vain Hopes?—The puffing gale of morn, That of its charms divests the dewy lawn, And robs each flow'ret of its gem,—and dies; A cobweb hiding disappointment's thorn, Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise. And thou, O Trouble?—nothing can suppose, (And sure the power of wisdom only knows,) What need requireth thee: So free and liberal as thy bounty flows, Some necessary cause must surely be: But disappointments, pains, and every woe Devoted wretches feel, The universal plagues of life below, Are mysteries still 'neath Fate's unbroken seal. And what is Death? is still the cause unfound? That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?— A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave. And Peace? where can its happiness abound?— No where at all, save heaven, and the grave. Then what is Life?—When stripp'd of its disguise, A thing to be desir'd it cannot be; Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes Gives proof sufficient of its vanity. 'Tis but a trial all must undergo; To teach unthankful mortals how to prize That happiness vain man's denied to know, Until he's call'd to claim it in the skies.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Just by the wooden brig a bird flew up, Frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down To reach the misty dewberry—let us stoop And seek its nest—the brook we need not dread, 'Tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown, So it sings harmless o'er its pebbly bed —Ay here it is, stuck close beside the bank Beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank Its husk seeds tall and high—'tis rudely planned Of bleachèd stubbles and the withered fare That last year's harvest left upon the land, Lined thinly with the horse's sable hair. Five eggs, pen-scribbled o'er with ink their shells Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads As nature's poesy and pastoral spells— They are the yellowhammer's and she dwells Most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds As sweet as Castaly to fancy seems And that old molehill like as Parnass' hill On which her partner haply sits and dreams O'er all her joys of song—so leave it still A happy home of sunshine, flowers and streams. Yet in the sweetest places cometh ill, A noisome weed that burthens every soil; For snakes are known with chill and deadly coil To watch such nests and seize the helpless young, And like as though the plague became a guest, Leaving a houseless home, a ruined nest— And mournful hath the little warblers sung When such like woes hath rent its little breast.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Master Hirano came from Japan together with a priest from the Kegon sect and the two of them drank beer all night at the Avia Hotel next to Ben Gurion airport. The following day, when we came to take them to the Galilee, they had trouble getting up and barely checked out of their rooms on time. It was a wintry January morning, and near the village of Shefaram the priest from the Kegon sect asked us to stop and stood by the side of the road and urinated. On Friday the two of them (Master Hirano and the priest from the Kegon sect) went to the Bratslav Hasids’ synagogue in Safed. The worshippers swayed like trees in the wind. Master Hirano and the priest from the Kegon sect stood there, bald and wrapped in robes, behind the congregation, and the beadle whispered into our ears: Are they Jews? Are they Jews? When we left the synagogue Master Hirano said to the priest from the Kegon sect: There is no doubt that they understand what devotion (he said shujaku) is. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. They know what devotion is. On Jerusalem Street, by the monument of the mortar, commemorating the ’48 war, Master Hirano said: Prayer is a good thing. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. Prayer is a good thing. Master Hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the Kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose, big and full, yellow like the fields painted by Van Gogh. * * * It’s possible to write only by means of non-writing.

How to approach I still don't know, nor on what words I might rely. Instruct me, Lord: advise and guide me. Free me from my prison of lies. Teach me while I can bear the affliction— do not, Lord, despise my plea; before I've become my own burden and the little I am weighs on me, and against my will, I give in as worms eat bones that weary of me. I'll come to the place my forefathers reached, and by their place of rest find rest. Earth's back to me is foreign; my one true home is in its dust.

How could I come to serve my Lord, when I am still desire's prisoner? How could I ask for a place on high, when I know the worm will be my sister? How at that end could my heart be glad, when I do not know what death will bring? Day after day and night after night reduce the flesh upon me to nothing. Into the winds they'll scatter my spirit. To dust they'll return the little remaining. What can I say—with desire my enemy, from boyhood till now pursuing me: What is Time to me but your Will? If you're not with me, what will I be?

My heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence; only toward them can one really advance, that is, make progress. Without them I feel I’m half a person. Romeo was born a Montague, and Juliet came from the Capulet line, and I’m a disciple of Shakespeare, not Ben Gurion— therefore I’ll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of Haidar Abdel Shafi. I mean this, of course, as a parable only—but the parable is my measure, and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair, this isn’t just some idle fancy that, out of poetic license, I place our fate in my daughter’s sex. That I grant myself this imaginary gift, testifies to the extent to which we’re living, still, in the underworld, where we’re granted the hope and potential of an amoeba. But all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl, spring out of the ground and devour each other, until a sacred union occurs, healing the breach in the world. The Arab groom from Gaza, too, will extend to my daughter a dress on which is embroidered the Land redeemed from Apartheid’s curse— our Land as a whole, belonging equally to all of its offspring, and then he’ll lift the veil from her face, and say to her: “And now I take you to be my wife, Lotem Abdel Shafi.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The Nut Garden holds things felt and thought and feeling for thought is always a palace— Sinai with flames of fire about it, burning though never by fire devoured. On all four sides surrounded so— entrance is barred to pretenders forever. For one who learns to be wise, however, its doors are open toward the East: he reaches out and takes a nut, then cracks its shell, and eats...@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I May the Name send its hidden radiance to open the gates of deliverance to His servants—and shine in their hearts, which now are shut in silent darkness. May the great King be moved to act in perfection and righteousness— to open the gates of wisdom for us and waken the love of old, the love of ancient days. ii By the power of the hidden Name I-am-that-I-am, and by the dew of Desire and Blessing, the dead will live again... iiiI-am is the power of your Name in concealment, and one who knows its mystery dwells in eternity’s instant. Over the world, it pours forth abundance and favor, and on it all worlds hang, like grapes in a cluster. Send the dew of blessing, the dew of grace; renew my dispensation, and grant me length of days. Bring light to my eyes with your teaching, and let not the husks that surround your hosts obstruct me. May Heaven and Adam’s children judge me with mercy. Sustain me with their strength and fortune— but do not leave me in need of the gifts of men.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Turn, sole one on high, to those who remember your sanctity, and accept our cry and plea— You who fathom all mysteries.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Poetry chooses choice things, carefully selecting select words, arranging, fabulously, things arranged. To put it differently is hard, if not out of the question. Poetry's like a clay plate. It's broken easily under the weight of all those poems. In the hands of the poet, it sings. In those of others, not only doesn't it sing, it's out of the question.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You dwell deep within— you’ve fixed the ends of creation. You stand, a tower for the near, refuge to those far off. You’ve lain above the Ark, here, yet live in the highest heavens. Exalted among your hosts, although beyond their hymns— no heavenly sphere could ever contain you, let alone a chamber within. In being borne above them on an exalted throne, you are closer to them than their breath and skin. Their mouths bear witness for them, that you alone gave them form. Your kingdom’s burden is theirs; who wouldn’t fear you? And who could fail to search for you— who sends down food when it is due? I sought your nearness. With all my heart I called you. And in my going out to meet you, I found you coming toward me, as in the wonders of your might and holy works I saw you. Who would say he hasn’t seen your glory as the heavens’ hordes declare their awe of you without a sound being heard? But could the Lord, in truth, dwell in men on earth? How would men you made from the dust and clay fathom your presence there, enthroned upon their praise? The creatures hovering over the world praise your wonders— your throne borne high above their heads, as you bear all forever.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I look in that one kind of dwindled. And in this, look up, a truncheon in my fist, tin pot on my head, the war. My father, I’m looking at, is my age then and thin, his pants streak to the ground, shadows of rosevines . . . His father sits beneath a cat. Here the shadow has more flavor than my trains, elbows on livingroom floor, bangs that curl, opera broadcast, The Surreptitious Adventures of Nightstick. I lie in the wind of the sun and hear toots and smell aluminium smoke. The tiny oval of my mother’s youth in back and the rest is dark. Sundays, the floor was black. At the beach, here I’m a nest of seaweed, an earlier portrait of surrealists I saw later, a stem of grey what rises from my scalp. My hair is peaked in brine. And this here hat, dark green fedora over same green corduroy suit for a trip to the nation’s capitol, how far askance I’ve been since and never another hat. Cromium rods, the hand in the guide’s pocket seems far removed. Blurry shoes on sandstone steps, double and over exposed. Then in this one the SECRET points to my head, shaved, and emblem, OPEN, striped in “pirate” T-shirt and HERE IT IS. My elbow bent, upright this time, behind a pole. I had yet to enter at this snap the cavern beneath my sneakers. To the right my soles protrude from beneath a boulder, for I had trapped my mother and she asked Why. Taken. Given. Flashlight brighter than my face, another grotto, where the ball of twine, indirection, gave out but we never got very far in, Connecticut. I swim out of another cave in a further frame, cramped gaze of sunlit days, apparel forgot. Later I reel in a yell as my cousin takes a bite from my shank beneath ranchhouse breezy curtains of Marion. On a trudge up from the gasoline rockpit in the gaze of Judy Lamb, she carries my pack, my jeans rolled as I step on a pipe. Estwing in hand and svelte as only youthful can. Most of those rocks remain and she married a so-so clarinetist. My greygreen zipper jacket leans against a concrete teepee, my father looking bullchested stands before. Perhaps we had just argued. Central Park cement steps of pigeons, the snow removed. Overexposed whiteshirt at the drums, stick fingers ride cymbal at the camera raised, livingroom Brenton with orange & black “sea” wallpaper and orange&black tubs. I wore a wristwatch then and never again, drumtime hitching me past it. I graduate from highschool in white dinner jacket and diploma and frown, too many hot shadows back of the garage. Must roll up the bedroll with skinny arms and lam for the caves. Dave & A. Bell by the Ford Company Squire first time allowed alone to tool Bleak grass scapes of Knox farm. Rope down a crack, mosquitoes and Koolade, sun dapple leaf moss sandwiches, ache. Then in this group more drums on the roof, the gravel and the flat, a cover attempt for no album even thought. I tap and step in the dim known street. Lean on a chimney to inhabit the sky, deep with drops. Here I’m pressed on a wall of Tennessee limes, stones-throw from mouth of the underground we camped in. Too many thoughts, elide. Then lie on a beach in a doughnut pattern shirt with a stick, a pipe?, in my mouth as my cousin grins shiny beyond. Truro, also waiting for the caves. With the poets then I’m fat and the driveway is dark, the clapboards all white in a day of all talk. This then all ends in color, my red bandana and shirt out on Devil’s Pulpit, open hand addressed to the grey where Hawthorne and Melville now view of a highschool. While the water still spills, and the cat squints at leaves blown, my father wears Brahms, families lean in on one for a group shot, and the rock remains shattered in a star.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

But it says nothing. And one is as quiet as if to say nothing moves me. Then there is the chair. And one speaks of the chair sitting at the table. Scraping against surfaces, opening the mouth. The object is a piece of thing before. One shifts in a chair and opens the talk. And the time it says nothing one moves. The table is too long as the wall. Not a thing but it stays and one opens as a mouth will begin. Speaking of the table, nothing but to avoid that of the wall. One could return over and over to the chair, the wall one is sitting at.

But it could not be brought to see what it could be brought. And the leaves are away again, teamed. A parent at the last and a parent in the middle. And as stones I thought it right.

Today is today, until the preposition taken up. Next to the tree sways. The sky in pieces the leaves part the leaves piece together. To and from a hand given all directions.

When I think of the man who lived in the house behind ours and how he killed his wife and then went into his own back yard, a few short feet from my bedroom window, and put the blue-black barrel of his 30.06 inside his mouth and pulled the trigger, I do not think about how much of the barrel he had to swallow before his fingers reached the trigger, nor the bullet that passed out the back of his neck, nor the wild orbit of blood that followed his crazy dance before he collapsed in a clatter over the trash cans, which woke me. Instead I think of how quickly his neighbors restored his humanity, remembering his passion for stars which brought him into his yard on clear nights, with a telescope and tripod, or the way he stood in the alley in his rubber boots and emptied the red slurry from his rock tumblers before he washed the glassy chunks of agate and petrified wood. And we remembered, too, the goose-neck lamp on the kitchen table that burned after dinner and how he worked in its bright circle to fashion flies and lures. The hook held firmly in a jeweler’s vise, while he wound the nylon thread around the haft and feathers. And bending closer to the light, he concentrated on tying the knots, pulling them tight against the coiled threads. And bending closer still, turning his head slightly toward the window, his eyes lost in the dark yard, he took the thread ends in his teeth and chewed them free. Perhaps he saw us standing on the sidewalk watching him, perhaps he didn’t. He was a man so much involved with what he did, and what he did was so much of his loneliness, our presence didn’t matter. No one’s did. So careful and precise were all his passions, he must have felt the hook with its tiny barbs against his lip, sharp and trigger-shaped. It must have been a common danger for him— the wet clear membrane of his mouth threatened by the flies and lures, the beautiful enticements he made with his own hands and the small loose thread ends which clung to the roof of his mouth and which he tried to spit out like an annoyance that would choke him.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A few of us—Hillary Clinton, Vlad Dracula, Oprah Winfrey, and Trotsky—peer through the kitchen window at a raccoon perched outside on a picnic table where it picks over chips, veggies, olives, and a chunk of pâte. Behind us others crowd the hallway, many more dance in the living room. Trotsky fusses with the bloody screwdriver puttied to her forehead. Hillary Clinton, whose voice is the rumble of a bowling ball, whose hands are hairy to the third knuckle, lifts his rubber chin to announce, “What a perfect mask it has!” While the Count whistling through his plastic fangs says, “Oh, and a nose like a chef.” Then one by one the other masks join in: “Tail of a gambler,” “a swashbuckler’s hips,” “feet of a cat burglar.” Trotsky scratches herself beneath her skirt and Hillary, whose lederhosen are so tight they form a codpiece, wraps his legs around Trotsky’s leg and humps like a dog. Dracula and Oprah, the married hosts, hold hands and then let go. Meanwhile the raccoon squats on the gherkins, extracts pimentos from olives, and sniffs abandoned cups of beer. A ghoul in the living room turns the music up and the house becomes a drum. The windows buzz. “Who do you love? Who do you love?” the singer sings. Our feathered arms, our stockinged legs. The intricate paws, the filleting tongue. We love what we are; we love what we’ve become.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When she came into his room he was asleep and when she touched him, he woke— her hand on his shoulder, her knee at his mouth, and in the darkness, she looked like a boy. When he tried to sit up she covered his ears with her hands: “Save ourselves from ourselves,” she said, and then a wind stirred in the room as if she’d placed those words in his mouth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The lump on his neck that no collar could hide, and the charity of his presence there in the neighborhood each fall, door-to-door, standing in the swept porches, waiting for the housewives to answer. The ugly, pitiable treeman, reddish and leathery from the sun. His baseball cap pulled tight over his head, the visor stiff as a beaver’s tail. Year after year, the bowsaw with its wide teeth and the long-handled toppers were all that announced his trade. And standing on the porch he advised nothing, though he coughed and hacked, covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches, where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging until the tree, all torso—lung and heart, ribs and hips and shoulders—, stood like a knotted goblet in the yard, a figure, as in allegory, of his own stunted self, rooted, alive. My mother tried hard to convince us we were all children of God and that the sick and maimed, the poor, were creatures born to special destinies so unique we could not understand. But who could understand pain’s redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed to translate into grace. The poor were always poor, the sick, sick—just as the treeman’s goiter did not respond to treatment, inscrutable, part of God’s plan, part of the unlovely element of love: the humbling, the pity, the scar of violence— a craving too frightening to name, or too tender, the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine and hauled them to the alley. And as if he counted it his real work, leaned against the fence and with his fingers picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the fire bell rang its two short, one long electric signal, the boys closest to the wall of windows had to raise the blinds and close the sashes, and then join the last of our line as it snaked out the classroom onto the field of asphalt where we stood, grade-by-grade, until the principal appeared with her gold Timex. We learned early that catastrophe must always be attended in silence, that death prefers us orderly and ordered, and that rules will save us from the chaos of our fear, so that even if we die, we die together, which was the calm almost consoling thought I had each time the yellow C.D. siren wailed and we would tuck ourselves beneath our sturdy desktops. Eyes averted from the windows, we’d wait for the drill to pass or until the nun’s rosary no longer clicked and we could hear her struggling to free herself from the leg-well of her desk, and then her call for us to rise and, like herself, brush off the dust gathered on our clothes. And then the lessons resumed. No thought of how easily we interred ourselves, though at home each would dream the mushroom cloud, the white cap of apocalypse whose funnel stem sucked glass from windows, air from lungs, and made all these rehearsals the sad and hollow gestures that they were, for we knew it in our bones that we would die, curled in a last defense— head on knees, arms locked around legs— the way I’ve seen it since in nursing homes and hospices: forms bedsheets can’t hide, as if in death the body takes on the soul’s compact shape, acrobatic, posed to tumble free of the desktop or bed and join the expanse and wide scatter of debris.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This dog standing in the middle of the street, tail stiff, fur bushy with fear, and a pedigree rabbit, its neck broken and bleeding beneath his paws, might have been forgiven or simply taken away and shot under different circumstances and no one would have said much, except his owner who’d gone out into the yard at the start of the commotion, having been involved at other times with the dog’s truancies, and yelled, “Bosco, Bosco, goddamnit!” but unavailing, and everyone understanding that once more Bosco had been taken over by the dark corner of his nature. But this other sentiment we shared as well: the man Who’d raised the rabbit shouldn’t husband something so rare and beautiful he couldn’t keep it from the likes of Bosco.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The shape of it bending like an eel or disfigured quarter moon, pink and green and brown, like a rainbow trout. The wall along my bed covered with the map I cut from the newspaper, and next to it the fishing calendar from Abonauder’s Texaco. The square cages of days with their numerals and effigies of moon and fish shaded to indicate the shape of the moon, the hunger of the fish. The white bread stripped of its crust, dampened, then dusted with flour, compressed into a tight ball, wrapped in foil and chilled all night. A piece of it pressed and shaped on the tip of an Eagle Claw hook, then lowered into the nesting holes of blue gill. The plastic bobber floating on the surface like a silent doorbell. A whole world of cause and effect, framed day-by-day and week-by-week. The passage of time as a kind of game in which I transferred numbers from the newspaper to the calendar. The body counts and their categories of NVRA, Marines, Montagnards. And each morning I put a bold X through the previous day not to erase or forget it but to connect the corners, make four triangles of the square. And it was rare if not impossible to catch the blue gill that swam and swam around the tidy pebble craters of their nests, or coax them out except in hostile swerves and feints toward the bait that hung like a balloon of gravity over their homes, a suspicious egg pouch or cocoon, something a storm might have dislodged from the bank and blown like a feared gift into the water, a thing swallowed whole then run with until the line played out and the hook set fast.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I In A major Poco sosteniao The laying tide of inarticulate air Breaks here in flowers as the sea in foam, But with no satin lisp of failing wave: The odor-laden winds are very still. An unimagined music here exhales In upcurled petal, dreamy bud half-furled, And variations of thin vivid leaf: Symphonic beauty that some god forgot. If form could waken into lyric sound, This flock of irises like poising birds Would feel song at their slender feathered throats, And pour into a grey-winged aria Their wrinkled silver fingermarked with pearl; That flight of ivory roses high along The airy azure of the larkspur spires Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales With tool-evasive rapture, phrase on phrase. Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash, And the black cypress like a deep bassoon Would hum a clouded amber melody. But all across the trudging ragged chords That are the tangled grasses in the heat, The mariposa lilies fluttering Like trills upon some archangelic flute, The roses and carnations and divine Small violets that voice the vanished god, There is a lure of passion-poignant tone Not flower-of-pomegranate—that finds the heart As stubborn oboes do—can breathe in air, Nor poppies, nor keen lime, nor orange-bloom. What zone of wonder in the ardent dusk Of trees that yearn and cannot understand, Vibrates as to the golden shepherd horn That stirs some great adagio with its cry And will not let it rest? 0 tender trees, Your orchid, like a shepherdess of dreams, Calls home her whitest dream from following Elusive laughter of the unmindful god! Vivace The iris people dance Like any nimble faun: To rhythmic radiance They foot it in the dawn. They dance and have no need Of crystal-dripping flute Or chuckling river-reed,— Their music hovers mute. The dawn-lights flutter by All noiseless, but they know! Such children of the sky Can hear the darkness go. But does the morning play Whatever they demand— Or amber-barred bourréOr silver saraband? THE POOLII. In A minor Allegretto Cool-hearted dim familiar of the doves, Thou coiled sweet water where they come to tell Their mellow legends and rehearse their loves, As what in April or in June befell of, —friend of Dryades Who lean to see where flower should be set To star the dusk of wreathed ivy braids, They have not left thy trees, Nor do tired fauns thy crystal kiss forget, Nor forest—nymphs astray from distant glades. Thou feelest with delight their showery feet Along thy mossy margin myrtle-starred, And thine the heart of wildness quick to beat At imprint of shy hoof upon thy sward: Yet who could know thee wild who art so cool, So heavenly—minded, templed in thy grove Of plumy cedar, larch and juniper? O strange ecstatic Pool, What unknown country art thou dreaming of, Or temple than this garden lovelier? Who made thy sky the silver side of leaves, And poised its orchid like a swan—white moon Whose disc of perfect pallor half deceives The mirror of thy limpid green lagoon, He loveth well thy ripple-feathered moods, Thy whims at dusk, thy rainbow look at dawn! Dream thou no more of vales Olympian: Where pale Olympus broods There were no orchid white as moon or swan, No sky of leaves, no garden—haunting Pan!

\"The link with poverty is there is there in the man's hat, too, for money has got to be brought in, got to be brought in somehow,\" M.D., The Lover. Poverty is in the language, it is in her gaze back. It seeps and oozes into every poverty-stricken word. Each word is used sparingly as if each word were currency. It is everywhere. It stains everything. It is everywhere. It flies about. It watches from every corner of the page. Poverty is not something one leaves behind. A child born into poverty will always feel its presence at the edges of everything. Even right now, you can feel it—it is in my words, these tiny fractured things.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

But the wind blew through me Like I was a hologram. If you say I am a mystic, Then fine: I’m a mystic. The trees are not trees, anyway.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I did not want my body Spackled in the world’s Black beads and broke Diamonds. What the world Wanted, I did not. Of the things It wanted. The body of Sunday Morning, the warm wine and The blood. The dripping fox Furs dragged through the black New York snow—the parked car, the pearls, To the first pew—the funders, The trustees, the bloat, the red weight of The world. Their faces. I wanted not That. I wanted Saint Francis, the love of His animals. The wolf, broken and bleeding— That was me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the middle of the night, fatherBrought me a falcon.By morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hillInto the highway.When they found me in that carMy sleeve stemmed in blood,I didn’t know what it wasI was trying to kill.I saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river.They were dressed in white and silent as a séance.It was then I spoke to the bird.Already God is shaking his black seedBack into me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Then, the police arrive — they don’t find me.I’m disguised as a boy in a champagne wigAnd hid inside the gold rattle of a warm Appalachia wind.Beneath the trash of willow, I am. The sorrowOf trailer parks and carnie uncles. The poorGirl’s underworld, a weedy thing. The night,With its kingdom of lanterns and awful blue lark.How we waited, how we hidLike wolves, in the revolving question of a field.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It was Christmastime, the balloons needed blowing, and so in the evening we sat together to blow balloons and tell jokes, and the cool air off the hills made me think of coffee, so I said, “Coffee would be nice,” and he said, “Yes, coffee would be nice,” and smiled as his thin fingers pulled the balloons from the plastic bags; so I went for coffee, and it takes a few minutes to make the coffee and I did not know if he wanted cow’s milk or condensed milk, and when I came out to ask him, he was gone, just like that, in the time it took me to think, cow’s milk or condensed; the balloons sat lightly on his still lap.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In every crowd, there is the one with horns, casually moving through the bodies as if this is the living room of a creature with horns, a long cloak and the song of tongues on the lips of the body. To see the horns, one’s heart rate must reach one hundred and seventy five beats per minute, at a rate faster than the blink of an eye, for the body with horns lives in the space between the blink and light — slow down the blink and somewhere in the white space between sight and sightlessness is twilight, and in that place, that gap, the stop-time, the horn- headed creatures appear, spinning, dancing, strolling through the crowd; and in the fever of revelation, you will understand why the shaman is filled with the hubris of creation, why the healer forgets herself and feels like angels about to take flight. My head throbs under the mosquito mesh, the drums do not stop through the night, the one with horns feeds me sour porridge and nuts and sways, Welcome, welcome.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Not so much the missing of things but the nostalgia of colors, their music, the ordinary revelation of a family’s life caught in the flop and dance, a jig, if you will, of their layers, outer and inner skins, the secret things so close to the body, the taste, the salt and sweet of blood, and shit, and piss, and then, rinsed and scrubbed, leaving beneath the astringent scent of soap a musky marker of self for strays to smell or imagine as they walk past the parade of the living on taut lines, propped by poles with nails for a hook, above the startling green of grass and hedge, the barefaced concrete steps, the sky, inscrutable as a wall; this is what one carries as a kind of sweetness — the labor of brown hands, elbow-deep in suds, the rituals of cleansing, the humility of a darning or a frayed crotch, the dignity of cleanliness, the democracy of truth, the way we lived our lives in the open.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I am a tornado child. I come like a swirl of black and darken up your day; I whip it all into my womb, lift you and your things, carry you to where you've never been, and maybe, if I feel good, I might bring you back, all warm and scared, heart humming wild like a bird after early sudden flight.I am a tornado child. I tremble at the elements. When thunder rolls my womb trembles, remembering the tweak of contractions that tightened to a wail when my mother pushed me out into the black of a tornado night.I am a tornado child, you can tell us from far, by the crazy of our hair; couldn't tame it if we tried. Even now I tie a bandanna to silence the din of anarchy in these coir-thick plaits.I am a tornado child born in the whirl of clouds; the center crumbled, then I came. My lovers know the blast of my chaotic giving; they tremble at the whip of my supple thighs; you cross me at your peril, I swallow light when the warm of anger lashes me into a spin, the pine trees bend to me swept in my gyrations.I am a tornado child. When the spirit takes my head, I hurtle into the vacuum of white sheets billowing and paint a swirl of color, streaked with my many songs.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

America is inconceivable without drugs and always has been. One of the first acts was to dump the tea. The drug that furnished the mansions of Virginia was tobacco, a drug now in much disrepute. Sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for and they dealt it by the bale altho it was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire— people were so simple in those days. The Civil War saw the isolation of morphine making amputation a pleasure and making the block of wood between the teeth, which was no drug, obsolete. Morphinism was soon widespread among doctors and patients. At this date interns, the reports tell us, are among the premier drug ab/users of said moralistic nation. “Rock” stars (who notoriously “have” doctors) consume drugs by the metric ton even as they urge teenagers to Say No. The undercurrent of American history has been the running aches and pains of the worn path to the door of the apothecary to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs by the gallon. It has been all prone all seeking Florida, Ponce de León was just the beginning of a statistical curve whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo. His eager search for youth has become our frantic tilt with death and boredom, in fact we are farming death in Florida with far greater profit than we are farming food in Iowa—elixirs are as multiform as the life-style frauds we implore, a cultural patchwork fit for a fool in the only country in the world with a shop called the Drug Store.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The show did not start off auspiciously, the contestants were nervous and kept fiddling with the wires attached to their privates, the men being especially anxious over the question of balls. The women were more querulous. The first question, a medical subject, was why had the anti-abortionists not mentioned, let alone commented on, the Baboon Heart transplant? One terrified contestant guessed it was because the moral majority’s nervous concern with evolution precluded their bringing it up. That hopeful contestant’s face reflected the malicious light in the eyes of the host who immediately threw the switch A powerful surge shot through the wires and both sexes screamed and writhed, to the delight of the vast viewership, estimated at 100 million, all of whom, presumably, were delighted not to be on the show, because not one in a million knew the answer.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The Baltic Sea froze in 1307. Birds flew north From the Mediterranean in early January. There were meteor storms throughout Europe. On the first day of Lent Two children took their own lives: Their bodies Were sewn into goatskins And were dragged by the hangman’s horse The three miles down to the sea. They were given a simple grave in the sand. The following Sunday, Meister Eckhart Shouted that a secret word Had been spoken to him. He preached That Mary Magdalene Sought a dead man in the tomb But, in her confusion, found Only two angels laughing. . . This was a consequence of her purity And her all too human grief. The Baltic Sea Also froze in 1303— Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Vivid and heavy, he strolls through dark brick kitchens Within the great house of Esterhazy: A deaf servant’s candle Is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about The green kindling! The wassail is Being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles Over thirty baked apples in a large bowl: into The wassail, young girls empty their aprons of Cinnamon, ground mace, and allspice berries. A cook adds Egg whites and brandy. The giant glass snifters On a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids. The anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig Stuffed with Devonshire cream. In the sinks the gallbladders Of geese are soaking in cold salted water. Walking in the storm, this evening, he passed Children in rags, singing carols; they were roped together In the drifting snow outside the palace gate. He knew he would remember those boys’ faces. . . There’s a procession into the kitchens: larger boys, each With a heavy shoe of coal. The pianist sits and looks Hard at a long black sausage. He will not eat Before playing the new sonata. Beside him The table sags with hams, kidney pies, and two shoulders Of lamb. A hand rings a bell in the parlor! No longer able to hide, he walks Straight into the large room that blinds him with light. He sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries. . . The simple sonata which He is playing has little To do with what he’s feeling: something larger Where a viola builds, in air, an infinite staircase. An oboe joins the viola, they struggle For a more florid harmony. But the silent violins now emerge And, like the big wing of a bird, smother everything In a darkness from which only a single horn escapes— That feels effaced by the composer’s dream. . . But he is not dreaming, The composer is finishing two performances simultaneously! He is back in the dark kitchens, sulking and counting His few florins—they have paid him With a snuffbox that was pressed With two diamonds, in Holland! This century discovers quinine. And the sketchbooks of a mad, sad musician Who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside A critic. He screamed: Here, take the snuffbox, I’ve filled It with the dander of dragons! He apologizes The next morning, instructing the landlord to take This stuff (Da Ist Der Wisch) to a publisher, And sell it! You'll have your velvet garters, Pig! The composer is deaf, loud, and feverish. . . he went To the countryside in a wet sedan chair. He said to himself: for the piper, seventy ducats! He’d curse While running his fingers through his tousled hair, he made The poor viola climb the stairs. He desired loquats, loquats with small pears! Ludwig, there are Spring bears under the pepper trees! The picnic by the stone house. . . the minnows Could have been sunlight striking fissures In the stream; Ludwig, where your feet are In the cold stream Everything is horizontal like the land and living. The stream saying, “In the beginning was the word And without the word Was not anything made that was made. . . But let us believe in the word, Ludwig, For it is like the sea grasses Off which with giant snails eat, at twilight!” But then The dream turns to autumn; the tinctures he Swallows are doing nothing for him, and he shows The physicians his spoon which has dissolved In the mixtures the chemist has given him! After the sonata was heard: the standing for applause Over, he walked out where it was snowing. It had been dark early that evening. It’s here that the Dream becomes shocking: he sees a doctor In white sleeves Who is sawing at the temporal bones of his ears. There is A bag of dampened plaster for the death mask. And Though he is dead, a pool of urine runs to the Middle of the sickroom. A brass urinal is on the floor, it is The shape of his ears rusting on gauze. The doctors Drink stale wassail. They frown over the dead Beethoven. Outside, The same March storm that swept through Vienna an hour before Has turned in its tracks like the black, caged panther On exhibit in the Esterhazys’ candlelit ballroom.

The General’s men sit at the door. Her eyes Are fat with belladonna. She’s naked Except for the small painted turtles That are drinking a flammable cloud Of rum and milk from her navel.

In the empty room of the manuscript Someone is grooming you For the long entrance into the dark city. They’ll hang the General. Then with torches they’ll search for his children. Men and women Are seen jumping from the burning hotel. Journalists, in no hurry, Elect to take the elevator. They walk Out of the building, stepping over corpses. . . You are listening to loud bells.

The vase was made of clay With spines of straw For strength. The sunbaked vase Soaked in a deep blue dye for days. The events in this wilderness, Portrayed in the round of the vase, Depend on shades of indigo against The masked areas of the clay, a flat pearl color To detail the big sky and snow... This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful: A bugle skips through notes: We view it all somehow from the center of the field And there are scattered groups of cavalry. Some of these Men were seasoned by civil war. Their caps are blue. Their canteens are frozen. The horses shake their heads Bothered by beads of ice, the needles of ice Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads. The long, blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches Of the horses. The ammunition wagons Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather... Beyond the wagons, farther even, into the woods There is a sloping streambed. This is The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood. From here through the bare trees there’s A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field: A valet is holding a bowl of cherries—archetype and rubric, A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color Which will flow through the woods in early December. An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth, unattended In the deep wash inside the woods. She knew the weather Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees To the earth to make a roof. The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth. Her legs spread, He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce. No stars Show through! But on the vase that belonged to a President There are countless stars above the soldiers’ campfires... With rawhide her feet are tied high in the spruce And her right hand is left loose as if she were about To ride a wild stallion to its conclusion in a box canyon. President Grant drinks bourbon from his boot. The Sioux Cough in their blankets... It snowed an hour more, and then the moon appeared. The unborn infant, Almost out on the forest floor, buckled and lodged. It died. Its mother died. Just before she closed her eyes She rubbed snow up and down inside of her bare thighs. In the near field an idle, stylish horse raised one leg To make a perfect right angle. Just then a ghost of snow formed Over the tents of the soldiers, It blows past the stylish, gray horse, Unstopped it moves through woods, up the streambed, And passes into the crude spruce shelter, into the raw open Woman, her legs raised into sky— Naked house of snow and ice! This gust of wind Spent the night within the woman. At sunrise, it left her mouth Tearing out trees, keeping the owls from sleep; it was angry now And into the field it spilled, into the bivouac of pony soldiers Who turned to the south, who turned back to the woods, who became Still. Blue all over! If there is snow still unspooling in the mountains Then there is time yet for the President to get his Indian vase And to fill it with bourbon from his boot and to put flowers into it: The flowers die in a window that looks out on a cherry tree Which heavy with fruit drops a branch: torn to its very heartwood By the red clusters of fruit, the branch fell Like her leg and foot Out of the sky into Montana...@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked Eggs; the weakest are Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth’s Men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate. The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country. The bear is baited: the nostrils Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley: And the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . . He took away the sun, took A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into The white lap of Elizabeth I—arrows and staves rained On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing Into the Queen’s private boxes—he grinned Into her battered eggshell face. Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth He showered Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council. The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept All that Sunday night and much of the next morning. Some said she was guilty of this and that. The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said: Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth. After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear’s skeleton Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside, Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then She spoke to it: You were a Christmas bear—behind your eyes I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling Of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have Troubled a Queen who was afraid When seated in shade which, standing, You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream Of you at night— Now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day You will be in this cold room—your constant grin, You’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are, Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A blind girl steps over the red staves Of a tub. Steam rising from her shoulders and hair, She walks across a dirt floor to you. I think you are not her grandfather. You watch with her a pink man Who has avoided taxes for two winters— He is being judged by roosters And has been chased this far into the countryside. Above him Burning sacks of bat dung are arranged In the purple branches of the thistle trees. The river is indifferent to him. And so are we. You tell your mistress the burning bags of shit Are like inert buddhas Dissolving in a field of merit. She giggles. A front tooth is loose. With the river bottom clear as the night air, The bargeman sings through the hungry vapors Rising now like white snakes behind him. You told his wife that Lord Buddha made wasps From yellow stalks of tobacco with a dark spit.

It is not 1937 for long. A clump of ash trees and a walk Down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up In a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings Of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle Of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while At their center the projectionist, Jean Renoir, On a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds, And turtles for the sleepy children. Corks Come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset And, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks Into the boathouse to the linens: at last, it is 1915! A bird screams over the lake, two bats Flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp, Interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over Water the the acceptance of white tablecloths On the darkening shore of the lake. A torch is lit For its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects. This film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders, Not music and algebra but A war and, then, yet another war. . . But we begin with the captured officers digging A tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall. The Boches observe the Frenchmen working With their hoes as from the trousers of a boy Dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure! The prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled With snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow While Germans with rifles on a hill Are unable to kill them, for they have escaped Into Switzerland with its feather-brushed trees And patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village. Isn’t this the ending of the film? No! I’m sorry but There is a single blossom On the geranium, and when it falls, Captain de Boeldieu Dies, discovering his afterlife along a November road— He does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh Beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film Suffers its true conclusion. The two men hiding In the marsh will escape across the border, only To be returned to the continuing war. This is why there Is no importance to your version of the story. And there Will be another war. And more horror for the geranium! So, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive A steamer trunk filled with women’s clothing, They will all perform in a revue: a chorus Of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings, Garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and Large paper carnations riding up like epaulets On their broad shoulders. These poignant inversions Are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right Has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous Until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing, In this comedy, their national anthem! The Russian Prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their Mysterious Czarina; the men open it expecting vodka And sausages. The box is filled with straw And books on cooking, painting, and algebra. In disgust They burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier Of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe! Now, these officers who are escape artists are moved As an elite corps and north to Wintersborn. Later, They are taken to a damp limestone castle From which no one will escape. The Commandant Is the stoic aristocrat, Rauffenstein, his head is in A brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon. I mean no disrespect, but the balding Rauffenstein is An abject picture of suffering. His villa has but one Flower, a tall laden geranium. Rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, Boeldieu, Are friends. Both would know that to clear a monocle One uses spirits of vinegar. They stand confirmed In manner beside a squirrel cage. Rauffenstein feels Superior to the other two principals, the rich Jew, Rosenthal, and the charming emotional Marechal. These two hide in the marsh while Boeldieu dies Of a bullet wound. Only a king may kill a king! And Rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim But missing the leg; he severed in three places Boeldieu’s intestine! The Captain is given a room in the turret that holds The flowering geranium. Now comes the oratio obliqua Of the marksman, Rauffenstein; the disfigured Commandant Is sincerely saddened At having ki@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Mistress Adrienne, I have been given a bed with a pink dresser In the hothouse Joining the Concord Public Library: the walls and roof are Glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, Violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. I get my meals With the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine To use. I scour, sweep, and dust. I hope you don’t think of me As a runaway? I remember your kindness, Your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. My journey was unusual. I saw some of the war And it was terrible even far up into the North. My first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis Where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened Quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first I helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox Of the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman In the passenger car who was searching for his runaway Negress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me, And I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into An open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me A man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl Maybe twelve years of age, across from them A sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, By afternoon she was dead, her two friends Just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture Frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. The girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces Just ran straight through me and all I could do was Squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters And hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms To mend and when the others slept I dressed in three Shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, The padding helped some but I couldn’t walk the next day. I hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock Of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall Split palings. The next morning from a hill I watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took Two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from A battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit In its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all The way to Youngstown. Chloe, you must Learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel. I am grateful. I had to swim two rivers. I fished some For perch, bream, and trout and ate dried berries. I stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse. I treated my sores with blackgum from poplars. I witnessed The hanging of three Confederate soldiers at a trestle: Once they were done dancing, they settled in their greatcoats Like dead folded birds. I have a hatred Of men and I walked away from the trestle singing. I spoke to The Concord Literary Club last Tuesday About my experiences. I told them you never did Abuse me. How we would sit out in the gazebo And listen to the boys with their violins, tambourines, Bones, drums and sticks. How we wept as girls When the fox bit the head off our peahen and that From that day how the peacock, missing his mate, would See her in his reflection in a downstairs window And fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations. When I left you the windows were all missing and daubers Were making their mud houses in the high corners Of the hallway. With sugar-water and crepe I have put a new Hem on my purple dress. At night I walk down the aisles Of the library, the books climb twenty feet above me, I just walk there naked with my tiny lamp. I have the need to fling the lamp sometimes: but I resist it. Mistress Adrienne, I saw three big cities burning! Did you know ladies from Philadelphia rode for two days In wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched The war like a horse-pulling contest at a fair. The man beside me on the train who was sucking the little Girl’s breasts, he was your stable boy, Napoleon. He said He never had a bad word for you. His little mistress was Still bare to the waist and before I leapt from the train, And while he slept, I ran a rod into his eye. I stabbed him In his brain. She stopped weeping.

The illegal ditch riders of the previous night Will deliver ice today. The barbers up in the trees are Chinese. They climb with bright cleats, bearing machetes— It’s a season Of low self-esteem for date palms on the street. My visitor was at the door yesterday. In a blue sere of a sucker suit. An I Like Ike button On the lapel. Holding a cup of sawdust. He breathed through his eyes, crusted With pollen. I was not confused. It was God Come to straighten my thoughts. Whole celestial vacuums In the trunk of his pink Studebaker. We would smoke and cough. I sat very still, almost at peace with myself. He had shot a deer in the mountains. He thought Last year’s winterkill was worse than usual. I told him I didn’t know about guns. Something forming on his forehead—a gloriole Of splattered sun over snow. We drank our lemonade in silence. He asked if he could go. He joked About his wife’s tuna casserole. As a gift I signed for him my last paperback. He left the book of matches. I’ll not enroll In the correspondence course it offers For commercial artists. What a relief That the barbers in the trees are Chinese. Green fronds are dropping in twos and threes Around the bungalow, lessons In the etiquette of diseased parrots. Bill Cody Said it first, “If there is no God, then I am His prophet.” Stop it.

Our clothes are still wet from wading The Chickamunga last evening. There is heavy frost. We have Walked on the dead all night. Now in the firelight We are exchanging shells and grapeshot. I can still hear our loud huzzah When late in the day The enemy fell into full retreat Along the pine ridge to the east. . . We chased them until we were weary. Each night this week There’s been something To keep me from sleep. Just an hour ago I saw A dead sharpshooter sitting Against a rock with a scallop Of biscuit still lodged in his mouth. He wore one silk sock. Snedikerhas returned from Chattanooga With five thousand convalescents For the left wing of their musketry. We have roasted a deer With a molasses sauce and pepper. Magrill and zandt have returned From horse hunting with a sack of sugar. By morning we will have buried our dead And fed the prisoners: Joe Cotton Will hang all seven of them in one tree When he sees they’re done Licking their fingers. . . I shot a Rebel yesterday In high water just for cursing me. Just six months ago For that alone it would have meant Three days in stockade. We can see now that cannonading Has set the hillside on fire. The wounded Grays Will be burned Beyond their Christian names. . . Joe Cotton says he’d ask God For rain, but he’s got no tent And river water Has chilled him straight through To the very quick of his being.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I’m a frogman. Naked by the water Under a lean of canvas she’d sewn With a thick paraffin thread, She gestured. When we pulled him From the river His left leg was meal. Crayfish in the hair. The river bottom left his shoulder Layered and crocheted— My sister’s pearl knitting needles Clicking in my head. I told The sheriff I wouldn’t do it again. I knew him once. His Chevy threw a rod. I made it with him On the hood of the old truck. It was out at the dump beyond Yuma. It felt like I had bread crumbs All over my mouth. Wacky with the sun, I sure did it with him enough That afternoon. I didn’t Know it was him who’d drowned. They said it was his cousin. He had a three-cornered scar At the small of his back. And a deposit Of calcium on the tailbone. We’re not much, you know? He was tangled in yellow tree roots, He spun in the currents, A fishhook and line running From his thumb. A whole new ball of wax, I thought. I wanted to be an astronaut. But failed the mathematics Twice in one summer. So I raise Nubian goats. My favorite has a purple manure That comes out like steaming packets Of tobacco mulch. He sprays The shack with his seed— It hasn’t needed paint in three years. I just took my shorts off When you two came down the hill. It’s that rubber suit I wear When I dive into the chute and cave. Sometimes I just feel Like old air in a patched tire. Then, I get my Seagram’s and come out here. You two look married. Not that I care. You wouldn’t believe what I was just thinking— Your husband’s the only living man Left in this country Who knows that I bleach my hair.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A horse is shivering flies off its ribs, grazing Through the stench of a sodden leachfield. On the broken stairs of a trailer A laughing fat girl in a T-shirt is pumping Milk from her swollen breasts, cats Lapping at the trails. There's a sheen of rhubarb On her dead fingernail. It's a humid morning. Tonight, with the moon washing some stars away, She'll go searching for an old bicycle in the shed; She'll find his father's treasures: Jars full of bent nails, a lacquered bass, And the scythe with spiders Nesting in the emptiness of the blade And in the bow of its pine shaft. Milling junk in the dark, She'll forget the bicycle, her getaway, And rescue A color photograph of an old matinee idol. Leaving the shed, she'll startle An owl out on the marsh. By November It will be nailed through the breast to the barn. In a year the owl will go on a shelf in the shed Where in thirty years there will be a music box Containing a lock of hair, her rosaries, Her birth certificate, And an impossibly sheer, salmon-pink scarf. What I want to know of my government is Doesn't poverty just fucking break your heart?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The island, you mustn’t say, had only rocks and scrub pine; Was on a blue, bright day like a blemish in this landscape. And Charlotte who is frail and the youngest of us collects Sticks and branches to start our fires, cries as they burn Because they resemble most what she has lost Or has little of: long fingers, her toes, And a left arm gone past the elbow, soon clear to her shoulder. She has the mouth of sea perch. Five of our sisters wear Green hoods. You are touched by all of this, but not by us. To be touched by us, to be kissed! Sometimes We see couples rowing in the distance in yellow coats. Sometimes they fish with handlines; we offend Everyone who is offended most And by everything and everyone. The five goats love us, though, And live in our dark houses. When they are Full with milk they climb the steps and beg that They be milked. Their teats brush the steps and leave thick Yellow trails of fresh milk. We are all females here. Even the ghosts. We must wash, of course, in salt water, But it smarts or maybe even hurts us. Often with a rope Around her waist Anne is lowered entirely into the water. She splashes around and screams in pain. Her screams Sometimes carry clear to the beaches on the Cape.For us I say so often. For us we say. For us! We are Human and not individual, we hold everything in common. We are individual, you could pick us out in a crowd. You did. This island is not our prison. We are not kept In; not even by our skin. Once Anne said she would love to be a Negro or a trout. We live without you. Father, I don’t know why I have written You all this; but be proud for I am living, and yet each day I am less and less your flesh. Someday, eventually, you Should only think of me as being a lightning bug on the lawn, Or the Negro fishing at the pond, or the fat trout he wraps In leaves that he is showing to someone. I’ll be Most everything for you. And I’ll be gone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A winter evening at the cottage by the bay, And I sat in the black and gold of the dead garden Wrapped in blankets, eating my sister’s suet pudding. The fountain was wrapped in dirty straw and Just below my property in the old Tartar cemetery There was a small funeral in progress: the widow Is wearing a purple shawl, the children are bare around The shoulders and the girls are wearing orange petals At their throats. The ashen white beards of the men Are like immaculate vests from this distance. There is nothing more intolerable than suet pudding, Unless it is the visitors. The drunken visitors laughing In my kitchen, eating my duck and venison, while I hide From them here in the dark garden. The daughter of one of these gentlemen is pretty. I saw her through the window drinking Champagne from a clay mug—just under her thin blouse I saw the blue points of her breasts that turn, In opposition, both out and up like the azure slippers Of the priest who is now singing in the cemetery below my house. Once the family has gone off with its torches I’ll Climb down to the fresh grave and drop some coins For flowers, even wooden teeth for the widow so she can Attract a new husband? The black, turned soil Or our garden reminds me Of the common grave given to the children Of the Godunov Orphanage after that horrible fire: A charred horse was thrown in with them, Bags of lime, and what I understood to be a large ham That the authorities, nevertheless, declared The torso of a male child of nine or ten. The Czar, In their memory, placed a tiny trout pond over them And this inscription: A blue blanket for my little ones. My wife goes nearly naked to parties in Moscow. My sister here, at Yalta, goes sea bathing with a rope Around her that runs back to the beach where it is Attached to a donkey who is commanded by a servant With a long switch. The sea tows her out and then the donkey is whipped Sorrowfully until he has dragged her back to them. I named the donkey, Moon, after the mystery of his service To my sister. This winter He has been an excellent friend. I read to this poor beast from Three Sisters. He is a better Critic and audience than I could find in the cities. I have won an Award that will save me from arrest anywhere Inside Russia. I am going to refuse it! And then travel To Nice or Paris. My tuberculosis is worse. Tolstoi reads my stories To his family after supper. And reads them badly, I suppose! I did walk that evening all the way down to the cemetery Only to discover that my pockets were empty. I screamed up to the house for coins, for plenty Of coins! The visitors, laughing and singing, ran down To me without coats and with a lantern swinging— My sister trailed behind them On her donkey. Her square black hat Bobbing like a steamer way out in the bay. And when they reached me— I said, “Sister, pack the trunks! You hurt me! I will write that we have departed for France, for Italy.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The first morning after anyone’s death, is it important To know that fields are wet, that the governess is Naked but with a scarf still covering her head, that She’s sitting on a gardener who’s wearing Just a blue shirt, or that he’s sitting on a chair in the kitchen. They look like they are rowing while instead outside in the mist Two boats are passing on the river, the gardener’s mouth Is opening: A white, screaming bird lifts off the river into the trees, Flies a short distance and is joined By a second bird, but then as if to destroy everything The two white birds are met by a third. The night Always fails. The cows are now standing in the barns. You can hear the milk as it drills into wooden pails.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

First there was the earth in my mouth. It was there like a running stream, the July fever sweating the delirium of August, and the green buckling under the sun.

No. I am not wishing that everyone should die. Nor am I wishing that everyone should be still. Only I am squeezing out the steam in me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Beloved, I have to adore the earth: The wind must have heard your voice once. It echoes and sings like you. The soil must have tasted you once. It is laden with your scent. The trees honor you in gold and blush when you pass. I know why the north country is frozen. It has been trying to preserve your memory. I know why the desert burns with fever. It was wept too long without you. On hands and knees, the ocean begs up the beach, and falls at your feet. I have to adore the mirror of the earth. You have taught her well how to be beautiful.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Vodu green clinching his waist, obi purple ringing his neck, Shango, God of the spirits, whispering in his ear, thunderlight stabbing the island of blood rising from his skull. Mojo bone in his fist strikes the sun from his eye. Iron claw makes his wrist. He recalls the rites of strength carved upon his chest. Black flame, like tongues of glass, ripples beneath a river of sweat. Strike the island! Strike the sun! Strike the eye of evil! Strike the guilty one! No power can stay the mojo when the obi is purple and the vodu is green and Shango is whispering, Bathe me in blood. I am not clean.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Up from Msippi I grew. (Bare walk and cane stalk make a hungry belly talk.) Up from the river of death. (Walk bare and stalk cane make a hungry belly talk.) Up from Msippi I grew. Up from the river of pain. Out of the long red earth dipping, rising, spreading out in deltas and plains, out of the strong black earth turning over by the iron plough, out of the swamp green earth dripping with moss and snakes, out of the loins of the leveed lands muscling its American vein: the great Father of Waters, I grew up, beside the prickly boll of white, beside the bone-filled Mississippi rolling on and on, breaking over, cutting off, ignoring my bleeding fingers. Bare stalk and sun walk I hear a boll-weevil talk cause I grew up beside the ox and the bow, beside the rock church and the shack row, beside the fox and the crow, beside the melons and maize, beside the hound dog, beside the pink hog, flea-hunting, mud-grunting, cat-fishing, dog pissing in the Mississippi rolling on and on, ignoring the colored coat I spun of cotton fibers. Cane-sweat river-boat nigger-bone floating. Up from Msippi I grew, wailing a song with every strain. Woman gone woe man too baby cry rent-pause daddy flew.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I Neon stripes tighten my wall where my crayon landlord hangs from a bent nail. My black father sits crooked in the kitchen drunk on Jesus’ blood turned to cheap wine. In his tremor he curses the landlord who grins from inside the rent book. My father’s eyes are bolls of cotton. He sits upon the landlord’s operating table, the needle of the nation sucking his soul. II Chains of light race over my stricken city. Glittering web spun by the white widow spider. I see this wild arena where we are harnessed by alien electric shadows. Even when the sun washes the debris I will recall my landlord hanging in my room and my father moaning in Jesus’ tomb. In America all zebras are in the zoo. I hear the piston bark and ibm spark: let us program rabies. the madness is foaming now. No wild zebras roam the American plain. The mad dogs are running. The African zebra is gone into the dust. I see the shadow thieves coming and my father on the specimen table.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This time I came to the starting placewith my best running shoes, and pure speedheld back for the finish, came with only loveof the clock and the underfootingand the other runners. Each of us would be testing excellence and endurancein the other, though in the past I’d oftenveer off to follow some feral distractiondown a side path, allowing myselfto pursue something odd or beautiful,becoming acquainted with a few of the waysnot to blame myself for failing to succeed.I had come to believe what’s beautifulhad more to do with daringto take yourself seriously, to staythe course, whatever the course might be.The person in front seemed ready to fade,his long, graceful stride shorteningas I came up along his side. I was sure nowI’d at least exceed my best time.But the man with the famous final kickalready had begun his move. Beautiful, I hearda spectator say, as if something inevitableabout to come from nowhere was again on its way.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The back roads I’ve traveled late at night, alone, a little drunk, wishing I were someone on whom nothing is lost, are the roads by day I take to the car wash in Hammonton or to Blue Anchor’s lawnmower repair shop when the self-propel mechanism goes. Fascinating how the lamplight that’s beckoned from solitary windows gives way to white shutters and occasionally a woman in her yard, bending over something conspicuously in bloom. So much then is duty, duty, duty, and so much with the sun visor tilted and destination known can be endured. But at night . . . no, even at night so much can be endured. I’ve known only one man who left the road, followed an intriguing light to its source. He told me that he knocked many times before it became clear to him he must break down the door.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The housework, the factory work, the work that takes from the body and does not put back. The white-collar work and the dirt of its profits, the terrible politeness of the office worker, the work that robs the viscera to pay the cool surfaces of the brain.

And the compulsive work after the work is done, those unfillable spaces of the Calvinist, or certain marriage beds.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Rent a flatbed with a winch. With the right leverage anything can be hoisted, driven off. Or the man with a Bobcat comes in, then the hauler with his enormous truck. A leveler or a lawyer does the rest; experts always are willing to help. The structure was old, rotten in spots. Hadn't it already begun to implode? Believe you've just sped the process up. Photographs, toys, the things that break your heart—let's trust they would have been removed, perhaps are safe with the children who soon will have children of their own. It's over. It's time for loss to build its tower in the yard where you are merely a spectator now. Admit you'd like to find something discarded or damaged, even gone, and lift it back into the world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Because the ostracized experience the world in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it clearly yet with such anger and longing that they sometimes enlarge what they see, she at first saw Brigantine as a paradise for gulls. She must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore. How startling, though, no one knew about her past, the scandal with Percy, the tragic early deaths, yet sad that her Frankenstein had become just a name, like Dracula or Satan, something that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh. She found herself welcome everywhere. People would tell her about Brigantine Castle, turned into a house of horror. They thought she'd be pleased that her monster roamed its dark corridors, making children scream. They lamented the day it was razed. Thus Mary Shelley found herself accepted by those who had no monster in them — the most frightening people alive, she thought. Didn't they know Frankenstein had abandoned his creation, set him loose without guidance or a name? Didn't they know what it feels like to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are? She was amazed now that people believed you could shop for everything you might need. She loved that in the dunes you could almost hide. At the computer store she asked an expert if there was such a thing as too much knowledge, or going too far? He directed her to a website where he thought the answers were. Yet Mary Shelley realized that the pain she felt all her life was gone. Could her children, dead so young, be alive somewhere, too? She couldn't know that only her famous mother had such a chance. She was almost ready to praise this awful world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Diarrhea: what nobody likes, though a word the French love to pronounce. They surround it with lips and tongue; it pleases, like saying cellar door does.

Anyone who begins a sentence with, “In all honesty ... ” is about to tell a lie. Anyone who says, “This is how I feel” had better love form more than disclosure. Same for anyone who thinks he thinks well because he had a thought. If you say, “You’re ugly” to an ugly person — no credit for honesty, which must always be a discovery, an act that qualifies as an achievement. If you persist you’re just a cruel bastard, a pig without a mirror, somebody who hasn’t examined himself enough. A hesitation hints at an attempt to be honest, suggests a difficulty is present. A good sentence needs a clause or two, interruptions, set off by commas, evidence of a slowing down, a rethinking. Before I asked my wife to marry me, I told her I’d never be fully honest. No one, she said, had ever said that to her. I was trying to be radically honest, I said, but in fact had another motive. A claim without a “but” in it is, at best, only half true. In all honesty, I was asking in advance to be forgiven.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Finally, I gave up on obeisance, and refused to welcome either retribution or the tease of sunny days. As for the can’t-be- seen, the sum-of-all-details, the One—oh, when it came to salvation I was only sure I needed to be spared someone else’s version of it. The small prayers I devised had in them the hard sounds of split and frost. I wanted them to speak as if it made sense to speak to what isn’t there in the beaconless dark. I wanted them to startle by how little they asked.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Just when it has seemed I couldn’t bear one more friend waking with a tumor, one more maniac with a perfect reason, often a sweetness has come and changed nothing in the world except the way I stumbled through it, for a while lost in the ignorance of loving someone or something, the world shrunk to mouth-size, hand-size, and never seeming small. I acknowledge there is no sweetness that doesn’t leave a stain, no sweetness that’s ever sufficiently sweet .... Tonight a friend called to say his lover was killed in a car he was driving. His voice was low and guttural, he repeated what he needed to repeat, and I repeated the one or two words we have for such grief until we were speaking only in tones. Often a sweetness comes as if on loan, stays just long enough to make sense of what it means to be alive, then returns to its dark source. As for me, I don’t care where it’s been, or what bitter road it’s traveled to come so far, to taste so good.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

When Claude says blessed is he who has seen and believes, you know he is about to tell the one about bees. His father told him which kind of sting was worst, but you have to see some things for yourself, and when you ask how on earth do you catch a bee to see anything, he tells how you hunker down next to a sweet potato blossom and watch until one lands on the ruffled cuff and then ambles down into the sweeter sleeve. You lean over and pinch the blossom shut, and there you have it, ready to sting yourself so you can decide on your own, and he wants for you not to doubt this: even more blessed, you will be, you have heard — and not seen.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It nuzzles oblivion, confuses itself with mud.

1 Claude says he, too, was given the tracks and not the train, the way — and not the way out, not the beyond beyond that bend, or the next. The place they call Drybridge — for the waterless bed of rails — where on the banks, you grow up learning more news from hoboes than from the mailman.But you know nothing of the train as it passes behind the backs of grander houses, gutted warehouses, chained dogs, as it grazes an alien grid of fences — of stone, metal, and chain-link. Or that when it passes beneath the underside of a bridge, a boy your own age waves the way you do, and that there is a horse doesn’t lift its head, and one that does, only to lower it again.2 You are a grown man when the train comes to a scalding stop, and a lantern swings down the road. A man has been killed, they call out from behind the light’s aura, and would you come see what you can tell of him by what’s left. You do know his hat, and that burn scar on the back of his hand. What you know of his wifeyou do not say and will not even the next night when you sit up with the body in the house he wanted that much shut of, her voice rigid as its walls while the train you hear out there in the darkness passes by the way it always does, as though the same, the very same, and, again, on the time it will this night be able to keep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The word itself: prim, retired, its artifact her portrait above the fireplace, on her face the boredom she abhorred, then perfected, her hands held upward—their emptiness a revision, cigarette and brandy snifter painted, intolerably, out, to leave her this lesser gesture: What next? or shrugged Whatever.From the waist down she was never there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The world has certified itself rid of all but the argument: to eradicate or not the small stock of variola frozen, quarantined—a dormancy it has refused, just once, for a woman behind a sterile lens, her glass slide a clearest, most becoming pane.

It was fifty cents a game beneath exhausted ceiling fans, the smoke’s old spiral. Hooded lights burned distant, dull. I was tired, but you insisted on one more, so I chalked the cue—the bored blue—broke, scratched. It was always possible for you to run the table, leave me nothing. But I recall the easy shot you missed, and then the way we both studied, circling—keeping what you had left me between us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Most of the things you made for me—blanket- chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker—I gave away to friends who could use them and not be reminded of the hours lost there, not having been witness to those designs, the tedious finishes. But I did keep the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, most of these years it has been invisible, part of the wall, or defined by reflection— safe—because reflection, after all, does change. I hung it here in the front, dark hallway of this house you will never see, so that it might magnify the meager light, become a lesser, backward window. No one pauses long before it. But this morning, as I put on my overcoat, then straightened my hair, I saw outside my face its frame you made for me, admiring for the first time the way the cherry you cut and planed yourself had darkened, just as you said it would.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My brother's funeral over, the dark-clothed congregation clots the church doors, a lingering aftermath moving into flat light—the sky low and swollen, a storm siren's long expansive notes, evenly measured, so loud the pauses between ring with aftersound. Used to it, no one here appears alarmed, the church ladies filing into his house bearing heavy covered dishes, the funeral flowers. On the muted television tuned to the weather, a small area of Watch now upgrades to Warning; the words stream across the bottom of the screen calling conditions perfect, this town, this house disappeared beneath the map's isolated lesion, its red edges uneven, stalled. The forecasters rely they say on spotters to confirm what the radar cannot—they call it ground truth; until then no one knows anything for certain beyond this inward watching. The room hums, an airless, crowded hive. Their mouths are full, plates layered—fried chicken, deviled eggs, casseroles, bright congealed salads with fruit suspended inside. All of it dust. I have come here too late, his body gone, already ash. The storm's body could be forming now, tightening from cloud to the gyre that will consume its path, all of it a becoming—spiraling a wall of water, mud, dust, and sand; with dispassion taking up into itself the fence line, a barn—the house beside them spared with the same dispassion. Or this, more likely now: siren silenced, the winds diminishing, the light, afternoon's concession to another dusk—severe, more common truth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
She perches high on the stand, gleaming whistle dangling, on her suit a dutiful, faded red cross. Mine her only life to guard, she does for a while watch the middle-aged woman who has nothing better to do than swim laps in the Y's indoor pool on a late Friday afternoon. I am slow, though, boring, length after predictable length of breaststroke or the duller lap of elementary backstroke perfectly executed within the taut confines of the brightly buoyed lane. So she abandons me to study split-ends, hangnail, wristwatch, until—the body of the whistle cupped loosely in her palm—her head nods toward shallow dreams. I've never felt so safe in my life, making flawless, practiced turns, pushing, invisible to reenter my own wake, reverse it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The my becomes a the, becomes the state’s the coroner’s, a law’s, something assignable, by me, alone, though it will not be the I I am on leaving it, no longer to be designated human or corpse: cadaver it will be, nameless patient stored in the deep hold of the hospital as in the storage of a ghost ship run aground —the secret in it that will, perhaps, stir again the wind that failed. It will be preserved, kept like larva, like a bullet sealed gleaming in its chamber. They will gather around it, probe and sample, argue — then return it to its between- world, remove their aprons and gloves and stroll, some evenings, a city block for a beer, a glass of chilled white wine. Even there, they will continue to speak of it, what they glean from beneath the narrative of scars, surgical cavities, the wondrous mess it became before I left it to them with what’s left of me, this name, a signature, a neatened suture, perfect, this last, selfish stitch.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One rusty horseshoe hangs on a nail above the door, still losing its luck, and a work-collar swings, an empty old noose. The silence waits, wild to be broken by hoofbeat and heavy harness slap, will founder but remain; while, outside, above the stable, eight, nine, now ten buzzards swing low in lazy loops, a loose black warp of patience, bearing the blank sky like a pall of wind on mourning wings. But the bones of this place are long picked clean. Only the hayrake's ribs still rise from the rampant grasses.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The town’s trees, roomy with winter, have begun of late to fill with them, a settling that commences with dusk. The widows complain —claim they can smell them, can hear them shuffling in the trees, a wing hitting a branch a sound sharp, they say, as ice cracking. They cannot sleep. And so you form a committee, convening with shotguns to fire every night into the darkling congregation. Every night, the air resounds with that resolve, and every dusk they return with theirs, circle, a lazy familiar vortex around a drain, an old appointment they keep with an inescapable place; this argument no way, Claude says, to be any less afraid.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I do not understand the poets who tell me that I should not personify. Every morning the willow auditions for a new role outside my bedroom window—today she is Clytemnestra; yesterday a Southern Belle, lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts. Nor do I like the mathematicians who tell me I cannot say, \"The zinnias are counting on their fingers,\" or \"The dog is practicing her geometry,\" even though every day I watch her using the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle from which she bisects the circumference of the lawn until she finds the place where the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped the ante by climbing into a new Euclidian plane. She stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention, her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, yes, even over themselves, until I go out to assist, by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, \"There! There!\" But instead of following my outstretched arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is now lounging under a canopy of leaves, catching its breath, charting its next escape, she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, confident that I—who can bring her home from across the field with a word, who can speak for the willow and the zinnia— can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I planted an apple tree in memory of my mother, who is not gone, but whose memory has become so transparent that she remembers slicing apples with her grandmother (yellow apples; blue bowl) better than the fruit that I hand her today. Still, she polishes the surface with her thumb, holds it to the light and says with no hesitation, Oh, Yellow Transparent . . . they're so fragile, you can almost seeto the core. She no longer remembers how to roll the crust, sweeten the sauce, but her desire is clear—it is pie that she wants. And so, I slice as close as I dare to the core— to that little cathedral to memory—where the seeds remember everything they need to know to become yellow and transparent.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

\"Myrtle loves Harry\"—It is sometimes hard to remember a thing like that, Hard to think about it, and no one knows what to do with it when he has it, So write it out on a billboard that stands under the yellow light of an \"L\" platform among popcorn wrappers and crushed cigars, A poster that says \"Mama I Love Crispy Wafers So.\" Leave it on a placard where somebody else gave the blonde lady a pencil moustache, and another perplexed citizen deposited: \"Jesus Saves.

Harry doesn't say \"Ziggin's Ointment for withered flesh, Cures thousands of men and women of moles, warts, red veins, flabby throat, scalp and hair diseases, Not expensive, and fully guaranteed.\" No, Harry says nothing at all, He smiles, And they kiss in the emerald meadows on the Sunday paper.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
On Fourteenth street the bugles blow, Bugles blow, bugles blow. The red, red, red, red banner floats Where sweating angels split their throats, Marching in burlap petticoats, Blow, bugles, blow. God is a ten car Bronx express, Red eyes round, red eyes round. \"Oh where is my lustful lamb tonight, His hair slicked down and his trousers tight? I'll grind him back to my glory light!\" Roll, subway, roll. Heaven is a free amusement park, Big gold dome, big gold dome. Movies at night: \"The life she led.\" Everyone sleeps in one big bed. The stars go around inside your head. Home, sweet home. On Fourteenth street the bugles blow, Bugles blow, bugles blow, The torpid stones and pavements wake, A million men and street-cars quake In time with angel breasts that shake, Blow, bugles, blow!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The dramatis personae include a fly-specked Monday evening, A cigar store with stagnant windows, Two crooked streets, Six policemen and Louie Glatz. Bass drums mumble and mutter an ominous portent As Louie Glatz holds up the cigar store and backs out with $14.92. Officer Dolan noticed something suspicious, it is supposed, And ordered him to halt, But dangerous, handsome, cross-eye'd Louie the rat Spoke with his gat, Rat-a-tat-tat— Rat-a-tat-tat And Dolan was buried as quickly as possible. But Louie didn't give a good god damn, He ran like a crazy shadow on a shadowy street With five policemen off that beat Hot on his trail, going Blam! Blam!-blam! While rat-a-tat-tat Rat-a-tat-tat Said Louie's gat, So loud that Peter Wendotti rolled away from his wife, Got out of bed to scratch his stomach and shiver on the cold floor Listening to the stammering syllables of instant death Met on secret floors in the big vacant galleries of night. Then Louie sagged and fell and ran. With seven bullets through his caved-in skull and those feeble brains Spilling out like soup. He crawled behind a water-hydrant and stood them off another half minute. \"I'm not shot,\" he yelled, \"I'm not shot,\" he screamed, \"it isn't me they've shot in the head,\" he laughed, \"Oh I don't give a damn!\" And rat-a-tat-tat Rat-a-tat-tat Muttered the gat Of Louie the rat, While the officers of the law went Blam! Blam!-blam! Soft music. Violins moan like weeds swaying far under water. The vibrant throats of steam-ships hoot a sad defiance at distance and nothing. Space curls its arm across the flat roofs and dreary streets. Bricks bulge and sag. Louie's soul arose through his mouth in the form of a derby hat That danced with cigarette butts and burned matches and specks of dust Where Louie sprawled. Close-up of Dolan's widow. Of Louie's mother. Picture of the fly-specked Monday evening and fade out slow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Getting drunk, a friend called women He had slept with, men he hated, And then 911, repeating \"Emergency\" like a schoolboy. \"Try 999,\" I suggested, Giving him the hot-line number That Malaysians, once, imagined Was the extension of the dead, Their calls, instead, directed to The homes for police and firemen And medical help, dispatchers Picking up for thousands who thought, Immediately, they had linked With the calm voices of the dead. Cautions? Disclaimers? Those callers, Regardless, asked about heaven's Lifestyle, what it meant to be dead. They chanted incantations to Ward off whatever might travel Through phone lines from the afterlife. \"What's the story with you,\" my friend Kept on repeating, receiving Sympathy, curses, threats, a fine. And the Malaysians? They, at last, Asked for help with the lottery— Because surely the selfless dead Knew the winning numbers, the sort Of thing you heard in paradise.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Balance is everything, is the only way to hold on. I've weighed the alternatives, the hold as harbor: It isn't safe to let go. But consider the hover, choices made, the moment between later and too late. Hesitation is later, regret too late. You can't keep turning and turning, or expecting to return. This earth is not a wheel, it is a rock that erodes, mountain by mountain. And I have been too soft, like sandstone, but there is a point where I stand without a story, immutable and moved, solid as a breath in winter air. I have seen my death and I know it is my neighbor, my brother, my keeper. In my life I am going to keep trying for the balance, remembering the risks and the value of extremes, and that experience teaches the length of allowable lean; that it is easier — and wiser — to balance a stone as if on one toe though it weigh a hundred pounds than to push it back against the curve of its own world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Darkness is not a death, does not obliterate, will not bury you or take your breath away. Darkness will not erase you the way it erases day with night because darkness is not the clock but merely the time falling away from the clock's circular face. Darkness is not the loss but the thing misplaced, not the hammer but the nail in its curved emergence from wood's grasp, not the storm's insurgence but the limbs broken off from their miraculous suspension in a storm out far, beyond us. Darkness is not about hearts, imperfect as they are, but what leaks through their incorrigible doors, not the stars but the glissade or glide of their dust. Darkness no longer shields the hunters' musk in search of you, or turns you to animal prey, it is only a measure of weight or days. Not something without a beginning or an end, it is not even—especially not—an end. Nor is it vertigo, nor the whole, but merely a piece. No, darkness is but a ghost of an idea, the least remembered, most estranged prayer, and your fear but a lingering, limbic fear torn from shreds of forgotten years. Only that much is clear.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I will hear his sleep in and through my own, my sleep will be bathed in his as if we slept in one same fluid My sleep floats within a listening so deep that the separating spaces of air become as pliant and full as snowfall, its singing silence as profound My ears and his throat — the sensation of anticipated hearing close inside the ear and the incipient murmur or cry forming at the end of his sleep — borne like birds and thrumming on the air of rooms between us My own sleep will be his clock, safely keeping time, his sleep tunes my dreams to listen, our sleep binds the hour, heavy and warm, into a blanket of air and sound@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It isn't true about the lambs. They are not meek. They are curious and wild, full of the passion of spring. They are lovable, and they are not silent when hungry. Tonight the last of the triplet lambs is piercing the quiet with its need. Its siblings are stronger and will not let it eat. I am its keeper, the farmer, its mother, I will go down to it in the dark, in the cold barn, and hold it in my arms. But it will not lie still—it is not meek. I will stand in the open doorway under the weight of watching trees and moon, and care for it as one of my own. But it will not love me—it is not meek. Drink, little one. Take what I can give you. Tonight the whole world prowls the perimeters of your life. Your anger keeps you alive— it's your only chance. So I know what I must do after I have fed you. I will shape my mouth to the shape of the sharpest words, even those bred in silence. I will impale with words every ear pressed upon open air. I will not be meek. You remind me of the necessity of having more hope than fear, and of sounding out terrible names. I am to cry out loud like a hungry lamb, cry loud enough to waken wolves in the night. No one can be allowed to sleep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It was twilight all day. Sometimes the smallest things weigh us down, small stones that we can't help admiring and palming. Look at the tiny way this lighter vein got inside. Look at the heavy gray dome of its sky. This is no immutable world. We know less than its atoms, rushing through. Light, light. Light as air, to them, for all we know. Trust me on this one, there is happiness at stake. Boulder, grain. Planet, dust: What fills the stones fills us. I remember, or I have a feeling, I could be living somewhere with you, weighted down the way we aren't now. Often the greatest things, those you'd think would be the heaviest, are the very ones that float.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It's hard to tell that the face of the moon is as much like a man's as god's. Out yonder, in the world without us, who's to say? — Either we get in the way, or things make use of us. Half-way around the globe from where they started, the static sound of starlings echoes off the barn roof. Spiders weave in the spokes of wheels, and stars circle unsuspecting suns. Little do we know, the world has a talent for making itself at home. Meanwhile, we paint our self- portraits on everything imaginable, then hold them up like mirrors. Our mercurial brushes grow longer, our skills more acute. Dust clouds the vision, tinder to the eye. So we burn trees to save the forests, burn air to fly afar. We do, we say. We can. The time is close at hand. Time was (said a man) you could tell the weather from the moon. That was before another broke the quicksilver distance and walked all over it. Now you can't tell a thing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One against the other across the fleetingly infinite field: that dry crackling of pallid corn stalks clacking comes close to it. behind them mountains range like steppes between the tiers of fog they coddle. it's autumn coming close again and you need to compare this one to autumns past, recall the other sputters of color too good to last. something you need to say, something you come close to: wind in its limitless visits— especially in fall when it cleans the overblown trees— wind in possession of you says it best. but you go on anyway, trying to pen the breeze: this fall phenomenon different from summer's in its macabre celebration of the lifeless, in its forever rewritten memory of what comes next. sorrel leaves swirling in a whirlwind mimic your own compulsive repetition, its own circle of yearning so close to a kind of comfort. quickening conversations of geese flocking south chill through your thin skin: behind it a choir of silence undefined rows you closer to what you'll never forget, what you almost remember this time. closer to its name. the heart overtaken. the bare staves waving at boughs' ends, the musical red wings: something they almost say, more like a sense hunched in darkness, an ache, a suspicion: every time, closer to it, closer. hear hard light on the hillside flatten the visible scale into two dimensions, and you're in love with the flatted third: the way it breaks you down, over and over, to mean you are alive. the way you rub it in the wound that you never come close to wanting to close— as if you could scrub away the whirling of everything else and come down like snow to the center, the eye, so close to the purity of knowing inside this present pain, that searing white place without wind or words.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
But it is not always quiet here. Things go on while we sleep the sleep of soldiers. Ancient branches crack and splinter into dust. Large wings snap open in spring like carpets splayed out over the railing. Granite splits apart at the seams and great animals cleave roads through woods. Daily, in the density, there is life on the edge of the knife that cuts the world into hemispheres of sense and death. Trees are born and die, bones turn to humus, glaciers to meadowland. It is time to turn yourself loose, like new leaves, like big lakes on which swim enormous birds at a distance deeper in breadth than the water's depth. Their shadows pull you to the shore. Their size fills your lungs with sky. It is time to heave aside the boulders and the dams, to come back out like a bear after the thaw, to be ready for the forest, for the forage, for the full and waning moons. You will get soaked in wet grass, feel the insects pierce your skin. You will learn to balance between gravity and light. There will be hot and sticky nights, sharp songs at dawn, long and bright ineffable days. This is your chance to crash your way through underbrush unlocking like so many doors.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Will death be like this? Like waking from a long dream still held—grounded— in the body disremembered? Spinning ceiling, close call? Foolish beating heart? Those trembling aftershocks of some electric message where bone met motion, clamoring in ligaments, that lingering tremolo singing in the ears like doubt, maybe the echo of some unrecognized once-familiar name. Estranged touch of wind over skin, on damp arms the hair not yet laid down . . . Breath's sour fluctuations not quite tamed. Cheeks' flush loosening, a displaced temperature sensed, unseasonal. Flash of light burning against walls, image after image, an eye, a frame, missing there. Where, searching, searchless, you can't point to or put a finger on, nevertheless an urge surging in raised fingers. A circle discontinuous, once rounded out by mouth. Throbbing inside the brow, no accessible thought. Specifically no memory arising from follicles still tingling, the dulling skull heedless, singed with salty pores. What if it's like this, only without the body?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Borne forward by extended increments. Crawling waterward from this weed wilted shore. Like small furred voles skittering inward, taking little grounded, mirrored steps: Like this, intervals of ice ridge and rime the pond rim. By night. As if by dreaming ice might cast its million limbs over that surface above. Its frozen tincture outfolding farther, farther unfurling across. By dawn: The moonspread scales then a foregone conclusion. Constructed, transmutable truth: All day ice shrinking from the light, reconsidering. And still, in leaving, leaving its lingering doubt, pale shadow of wingspan edgebound. Near. Then again in dark the cold falling, fallen to glow on the meniscus, ice groping forward with more sliding white. Ice: Its own logic, growing: Its horizontal precipice. Its glass carapace. Night's cold and hoary frost. Vaster still till all its heirs' outstretched tips interslip, imprint with their ferny whorls an entire span between lands. To travel that unthinkably far! And then, having reached to cry out more room!—crack like a shell, heave between its crushing shores. But which pressing which? And what boundary divides water from ice, what self solidifies against self, which is water—host or whore? Ice now in spring dissolving, dissolute reversal by increments retreating. Not I, alive, here mudnudged under eaves, forming my young egg by egg, mother's lasting bequest. To nest once in heat. To hatch and be born.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What hand opened the door, I don't know. No one lives there in winter. And I don't know if it was for entrance or for exit that the place opened itself, or was opened, though I do know what boundaries were broken. The lake lay frozen, the sky still as folded wings. And everywhere snow blown into the rooms, strewn across the braided rugs and knotty boards, under chairs, creeping like a slow cold tide, white and silent, out of its element with greed. Then I remembered the photograph, black and white, as old as me or older. What eye watched that scene, taking it in, shameless, I don't know, though I do know that boundaries were broken: A woman, her grey dress blowing toward land, lost on the shore in the dim light of her long day's end, and a man, farther up the beach, alone. The sea— mute, infinite entity—taking in its borders hungrily; and the stolen child it drank up when each entered the other in a moment of dropped vigilance. In this kind of world no blueprint instructs us how to house what we love against the winds of loss. The woman, the man, their child gone—slipped from the safe home of their love, swallowed whole. I am not going to try to feel what that woman felt, or to speak with her voice. I don't know what she did next or how she did what she did next. She is the mother, my fear, all the love ever lost to grief. Her pain is an ocean vaster than planets, a diaspora of longing flung to all four flogging winds. In her life, I am sure that time drifted past her, with her, within her. I know that that summer, like all summers, moved on through the fall into winter, that the shore closed up, abandoned, cold. And that the thing lost still blows through us, the swollen door no longer shuts.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In the morning of the tribe this name Ancapagari was given to these mountains. The name, then alive, spread into the world and never returned. Ancapagari: no foot-step ever spoken, no mule deer killed from its foothold, left for dead. Ancapagari opened the stones. Pine roots gripped peak rock with their claws. Water dug into the earth and vanished, boiling up again in another place. The water was bitten by aspen, generations of aspen shot their light colored trunks into space. Ancapagari. At that time, if the whisper was in your mouth, you were lighted. Now these people are buried. The root-taking, finished. Buried in everything, thousands taken root. The roots swell, nesting. Openings widen for the roots to surface. They sway within you in steady wind of your breath. You are forever swinging between this being and another, one being and another. There is a word for it crawling in your mouth each night. Speak it. Ancapagari has circled, returned to these highlands. The yellow pines deathless, the sparrow hawks scull, the waters are going numb. Ancapagari longs to be spoken in each tongue. It is the name of the god who has come from among us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We were thirty-one souls all, he said, on the gray-sick of sea in a cold rubber boat, rising and falling in our filth. By morning this didn’t matter, no land was in sight, all were soaked to the bone, living and dead. We could still float, we said, from war to war. What lay behind us but ruins of stone piled on ruins of stone? City called “mother of the poor” surrounded by fields of cotton and millet, city of jewelers and cloak-makers, with the oldest church in Christendom and the Sword of Allah. If anyone remains there now, he assures, they would be utterly alone. There is a hotel named for it in Rome two hundred meters from the Piazza di Spagna, where you can have breakfast under the portraits of film stars. There the staff cannot do enough for you. But I am talking nonsense again, as I have since that night we fetched a child, not ours, from the sea, drifting face- down in a life vest, its eyes taken by fish or the birds above us. After that, Aleppo went up in smoke, and Raqqa came under a rain of leaflets warning everyone to go. Leave, yes, but go where? We lived through the Americans and Russians, through Americans again, many nights of death from the clouds, mornings surprised to be waking from the sleep of death, still unburied and alive but with no safe place. Leave, yes, we obey the leaflets, but go where? To the sea to be eaten, to the shores of Europe to be caged? To camp misery and camp remain here. I ask you then, where? You tell me you are a poet. If so, our destination is the same. I find myself now the boatman, driving a taxi at the end of the world. I will see that you arrive safely, my friend, I will get you there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD is true. I was in his house. His wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them- selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground. May 1978@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Sleep to sleep through thirty years of night,a child herself with child, for whom we searchedthrough here, or there, amidst bones still sleeved and trousered,a spine picked clean, a paint can, a skull with hairSewn into the hem of memory: Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,God not of philosophers or scholars. God not of poets. Night to night:child walking toward me through burning maizeover the clean bones of those whose fleshwas lifted by zopilotes into heaven.So that is how we ascend! In the clawed feet of fallen angels. To be assembled again in the work rooms of clouds.She rose from where they found her lyingnot far from a water urn, leaving herself behind on the groundwhere they found her, holding her armsbefore her as if she were asleep.That is how she appears to me: a ghost in heaven.Carrying her arms in her arms.Blue smoke from corn cribs, flap of wings.On the walls of the city streets a plague of initials.Walking through a fire-lit river to a burning house: dead Singersewing machine and piece of dress. Outside a cashew tree wept blackened cashews over lamina. Outside paper fireflies rose to the stars.Bring penicillin if you can, surgical tape, a whetstone, mosquito repellent but not the aerosol kind. Especially bring a syringe for sucking phlegm,a knife, wooden sticks, a surgical clamp, and plastic bags.You will need a bottle of cloud for anesthesia.Like the flight of a crane through colorless dreams.When a leech opens your flesh it leaves a small volcano.Always pour turpentine over your hair before going to sleep.Such experiences as these are forgotten before memory intrudes.The girl was found (don’t say this)with a man’s severed head stuffed into her where a child would have been.No one knew who the man was. Another of the dead. So they had not, after all, killed a pregnant girl. This was a relief to them.That sound in the brush? A settling of wind in sorghum.If they capture you, talk.Talk. Please yes. You heard me right the first time.You will be asked who you are.Eventually, we are all asked who we are.All who come All who come into the worldAll who come into the world are sent.Open your curtain of spirit.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The bleached wood massed in bone piles, we pulled it from dark beach and built fire in a fenced clearing. The posts’ blunt stubs sank down, they circled and were roofed by milled lumber dragged at one time to the coast. We slept there. Each morning the minus tide— weeds flowed it like hair swimming. The starfish gripped rock, pastel, rough. Fish bones lay in sun. Each noon the milk fog sank from cloud cover, came in our clothes and held them tighter on us. Sea stacks stood and disappeared. They came back when the sun scrubbed out the inlet. We went down to piles to get mussels, I made my shirt a bowl of mussel stones, carted them to our grate where they smoked apart. I pulled the mussel lip bodies out, chewed their squeak. We went up the path for fresh water, berries. Hardly speaking, thinking. During low tide we crossed to the island, climbed its wet summit. The redfoots and pelicans dropped for fish. Oclets so silent fell toward water with linked feet. Jacynthe said little. Long since we had spoken Nova Scotia,Michigan, and knew beauty in saying nothing. She told me about her mother who would come at them with bread knives then stop herself, her face emptied. I told her about me, never lied. At night at times the moon floated. We sat with arms tight watching flames spit, snap. On stone and sand picking up wood shaped like a body, like a gull. I ran barefoot not only on beach but harsh gravels up through the woods. I shit easy, covered my dropping. Some nights, no fires, we watched sea pucker and get stabbed by the beacon circling on Tatoosh. 2 I stripped and spread on the sea lip, stretched to the slap of the foam and the vast red dulce. Jacynthe gripped the earth in her fists, opened— the boil of the tide shuffled into her. The beach revolved, headlands behind us put their pines in the sun. Gulls turned a strong sky. Their pained wings held, they bit water quick, lifted. Their looping eyes continually measure the distance from us, bare women who do not touch. Rocks drowsed, holes filled with suds from a distance. A deep laugh bounced in my flesh and sprayed her. 3 Flies crawled us, Jacynthe crawled. With her palms she spread my calves, she moved my heels from each other. A woman’s mouth is not different, sand moved wild beneath me, her long hair wiped my legs, with women there is sucking, the water slops our bodies. We come clean, our clits beat like twins to the loons rising up. We are awake. Snails sprinkle our gulps. Fish die in our grips, there is sand in the anus of dancing. Tatoosh Island hardens in the distance. We see its empty stones sticking out of the sea again. Jacynthe holds tinder under fire to cook the night’s wood.If we had men I would make milk in me simply. She is quiet. I like that you cover your teeth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We spend our morning in the flower stalls counting the dark tongues of bells that hang from ropes waiting for the silence of an hour. We find a table, ask for paella, cold soup and wine, where a calm light trembles years behind us. In Buenos Aires only three years ago, it was the last time his hand slipped into her dress, with pearls cooling her throat and bells like these, chipping at the night— As she talks, the hollow clopping of a horse, the sound of bones touched together. The paella comes, a bed of rice and camarones, fingers and shells, the lips of those whose lips have been removed, mussels the soft blue of a leg socket. This is not paella, this is what has become of those who remained in Buenos Aires. This is the ring of a rifle report on the stones, her hand over her mouth, her husband falling against her. These are the flowers we bought this morning, the dahlias tossed on his grave and bells waiting with their tongues cut out for this particular silence.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A peacock on an olive branch looks beyond the grove to the road, beyond the road to the sea, blank-lit, where a sailboat anchors to a cove. As it is morning, below deck a man is pouring water into a cup, listening to the radio-talk of the ships: barges dead in the calms awaiting port call, pleasure boats whose lights hours ago went out, fishermen setting their nets for mullet, as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines, whisper smoke into wood ovens, sweep the terraces clear of night, putting the music out with morning light, and for the breath of an hour it is possible to consider the waters of this sea wine-dark, to remember that there was no word for blue among the ancients, but there was the whirring sound before the oars of the great triremes sang out of the seam of world, through pine-sieved winds silvered by salt flats until they were light enough to pass for breath from the heavens, troubled enough to fell ships and darken thought — then as now the clouds pass, roosters sleep in their huts, the sea flattens under glass air, but there is nothing to hold us there: not the quiet of marble nor the luff of sail, fields of thyme, a vineyard at harvest, and the sea filled with the bones of those in flight from wars east and south, our wars, their remains scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves, belongings now a flotsam washed to the rocks. Stand here and look into the distant haze, there where the holy mountain with its thousand monks wraps itself in shawls of rain, then look to the west, where the rubber boats tipped into the tough waves. Rest your eyes there, remembering the words of Anacreon, himself a refugee of war, who appears in the writings of Herodotus:I love and do not love, I am mad and I am not mad. Like you he thought himself not better, nor worse than anyone else.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
On the phonograph, the voice of a woman already dead for three decades, singing of a man who could make her do anything. On the table, two fragile glasses of black wine, a bottle wrapped in its towel. It is that room, the one we took in every city, it is as I remember: the bed, a block of moonlight and pillows. My fingernails, pecks of light on your thighs. The stink of the fire escape. The wet butts of cigarettes you crushed one after another. How I watched the morning come as you slept, more my son than a man ten years older. How my breasts feel, years later, the tongues swishing in my dress, some yours, some left by other men. Since then, I have always wakened first, I have learned to leave a bed without being seen and have stood at the washbasins, wiping oil and salt from my skin, staring at the cupped water in my two hands. I have kept everything you whispered to me then. I can remember it now as I see you again, how much tenderness we could wedge between a stairwell and a police lock, or as it was, as it still is, in the voice of a woman singing of a man who could make her do anything.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We rise from the snow where we’ve lain on our backs and flown like children, from the imprint of perfect wings and cold gowns, and we stagger together wine-breathed into town where our people are building their armies again, short years after body bags, after burnings. There is a man I’ve come to love after thirty, and we have our rituals of coffee, of airports, regret. After love we smoke and sleep with magazines, two shot glasses and the black and white collapse of hours. In what time do we live that it is too late to have children? In what place that we consider the various ways to leave? There is no list long enough for a selective service card shriveling under a match, the prison that comes of it, a flag in the wind eaten from its pole and boys sent back in trash bags. We’ll tell you. You were at that time learning fractions. We’ll tell you about fractions. Half of us are dead or quiet or lost. Let them speak for themselves. We lie down in the fields and leave behind the corpses of angels.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Swallows carve lake wind, trailers lined up, fish tins. The fires of a thousand small camps spilled on a hillside. I pull leeks, morels from the soil, fry chubs from the lake in moonlight. I hear someone, hear the splash, groan of a waterpump, wipe my mouth. Fish grease spits at darkness. Once I nudged a canoe through that water, letting its paddle lift, drip. I was sucked down smaller than the sound of the dropping, looked out from where I had vanished.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I take off my shirt, I show you. I shaved the hair out under my arms. I roll up my pants, I scraped off the hair on my legs with a knife, getting white. My hair is the color of chopped maples. My eyes dark as beans cooked in the south. (Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills) Skin polished as a Ming bowl showing its blood cracks, its age, I have hundreds of names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet. In the night I come to you and it seems a shame to waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man. You recognize strangers, think you lived through destruction. You can’t explain this night, my face, your memory. You want to know what I know? Your own hands are lying.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
By boat to Seurasaari where the small fish were called vendace. A man blew a horn of birchwood toward the nightless sea.Still voice. Fire that is no fire. Ahead years unknown to be lived—Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then one by one, hours. Outside (so fleetingly) ourselves—In a still mirror, in a blue within where this earthly journey dreamingitself begins,thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.Mountains before and behind, heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.Spent fuel, burntwind, mute swans. We drove the birch-lined highway from Dresden to Berlin behind armored cars in late afternoon, nineteenth of June, passing the black cloud of a freight truck from Budapest.Through disappearingvillages, past horses grazing vanished fields.The year before you died, America went to war again on the other side of the world.This is how the earth becomes, you said, a grotto of skeletons. In the ruins of a station: a soaked bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.White weather, chalk and basalt, puffins, fuchsia and history shot through with particles of recognition: this one wetted down with petrol then set alight, that one taking forty rounds, this other found eleven years later in a bog.In the station house, imaginary maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry of arrivals, the logs of ghost ships and a few prison diaries written on tissue paper.Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies? The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze? Through the casements of glass hand-blown before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigsin wind through glass.Who were we then? Such a laughter as morning peeled its light from us! You said the cemeteries were full in a voice like wind plaiting willows—fields in bloom but silent without grasshoppers or bees. What do you want then? You with your neverness, your unknown, your book of things, youwith once years ahead to be lived.Your father believes he took you with him, that you arein an urn beside your sleeping motherbut I am still writing with your hand,as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.Such is the piano’s sadness and the rifle’s moonlight. Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not—do not, upon waking, gaze out a window if you wish to remember your dreamAn ache of hope that you will come back—the cawing flock is not your coming.Did you float toward Salzburg? A windin the mustard fields?—or walk instead beside me through the asylum in Krakow? Hours after your death you seemed everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight. Now your moments are cloudsin a photograph of swifts. In the hour held open between day and night under the meteor showers of Perseidwe held each other for the last time.Dead, you whispered where is the road? There, through the last of the sentences, just there—through the last of the sentences, the road—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They call you the New World but I close my eyes and the cold is a cloud that envelopes history. Sorrow is ancient. It’s raining. It rains on every word and on the verses that I write. These blue days and this childhood sun are the rain soaking a house in ruins. The ocean is the homeland of pain. I can hear the drums of victory that silence the night of those in exile. I can hear the clouds floating past, the ocean currents and the footsteps of the young clambering over the weeping piers. This is the future, to contemplate how the armies advance, how fire devours lips and clouds in a twilight of pulpits and the blood of innocents, clean and clear blood that once was love and lightning. I can listen, but it’s no use, my voice does not join with the children’s singing nor the dawn surrounding the foreign country of happiness. This is the future, an afternoon of rain spilled into the sea, a shadow that stalks the names and songs, the face of my mother under the barren land. Translated from the Spanish@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
After the sea, the whole sea, the cold land, the icy wind that comes from Nova Scotia and is a snow crab in the boots of a Maine fisherman who comes home for dinner, a bowl of hot soup returns the rosiness to his lips, then he watches a log burn in the fireplace, only fire has learned to climb on the cold, it’s not that fierce for someone who has seen the sea rising in a storm. The northern shores are a lament, the crying descends through its gorges until it touches the surface of the waves, on the rocks its mark remains, as in the faces of those who have suffered, pain leaves its ruin. In the northern ports it dawns early and life is as ancient as an old sea lion. This is the shore of the first colonists from the oldest island in the world, they came chasing opportunities, following the ocean currents while they prayed, they came because they followed the word of God to a rocky shore touched by tears over the same ocean from whence they came. They brought the songs, the nets, their words, they brought the hook and their churches, but also sin. The devil pursues his own opportunities. The bodies of the witches of New England are hanging, they hang before the multitude a few steps from Salem Harbor where fishermen set out each night in the direction of the land of their birth. In the northern ports, life comes back with the smell of fish. It’s New England time, the sun comes like an old puritan and it rises over the ocean and gives leave to the flight of the birds, it lights a window in Amherst where the eyes of a woman contemplate the world,love is anterior to life, but it departs with the birds of the dawn through her window. The sun comes on the footprints of men, it comes over the trees, it is reflected in the lakes, it follows its route strictly, without going off course, with a will that only faith can provide, the faith that arrived with the first ships to populate mountains. But with it also came indecision and doubt, the East and the West, watchful eyes, races, hooks, Sundays, even continents without lines on the maps, but also the maps with their borders, freedom, the roads that diverge in a yellow wood. New England’s time has come, the sun comes from the east like a ship sent forth by the future. Translated from the Spanish@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
They always followed you. Disdainful dogs, they made you lose your balance. You had to shout blasphemies into shadows trying to put out the din of their barking. Other times it was advisable to talk and try to calm them, whispers could be more convincing and stop them on any corner, so as to continue alone. Solitude is a walk through the streets of Baltimore. You could never free yourself, those shadows were growing, crows perched on the statues with eyes fixed on the emptiness of a demon who dreams. To you, who were on the edge of a dismal midnight watching specters of dying embers on the ground. To you, who tasted sorrow, who drank it like an exquisite liqueur, I come close and I look at you trying to find you on the other side of the stone carved by misfortune, the same as happens with beauty. Never again will the silver bells ring, the ships that now arrive at the port of Baltimore are filled with people too frightened to speak. They bring a stone in place of the heart, they do not sense these shadows that wander the streets, these shadows that are neither men nor women nor beasts, perhaps dogs or birds or words in the beaks of the birds or in their jaws. When they pass they are nothing more than the sea breeze from which they come. There is a silence now about silence in the shadows. They bite like words in place of the heart.

She was cleaning—there is always that to do—when she found, at the top of the closet, his old silk vest. She called me to look at it, unrolling it carefully like something live might fall out. Then we spread it on the kitchen table and smoothed the wrinkles down, making our hands heavy until its shape against Formica came back and the little tips that would have pointed to his pockets lay flat. The buttons were all there. I held my arms out and she looped the wide armholes over them. “That’s one thing I never wanted to be,” she said, “a man.” I went into the bathroom to see how I looked in the sheen and sadness. Wind chimes off-key in the alcove. Then her crying so I stood back in the sink-light where the porcelain had been staring. Time to go to her, I thought, with that other mind, and stood still.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I go to the mountain side of the house to cut saplings, and clear a view to snow on the mountain. But when I look up, saw in hand, I see a nest clutched in the uppermost branches. I don’t cut that one. I don’t cut the others either. Suddenly, in every tree, an unseen nest where a mountain would be. for Drago Štambuk@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When we stop where you lived, the house has thickened, the entry level to the wall with bricks, as though it could keep you out. Again the dream has fooled you into waking and we have walked out past ourselves, through the windows to be remembered in the light of closed rooms as a series of impositions across the arms of a chair, that woman’s face startled out of us so it lingers along a brick front. You are leading me back to the burned arcade where you said I stood with you in your childhood last night, your childhood which includes me now as surely as the look of that missing face between the rows of houses. We have gone so far into your past that nothing reflects us. No sun gleams from the glassless frame where a room burned, though the house stayed whole. There is your school, your church, the place you drank cider at lunch time. New rows of houses are going up. Children play quietly in a stairwell. Walking back, you tell the story of the sniper’s bullet making two clean holes in the taxi, how the driver ducked and drove on like nothing happened. No pain passed through you; it did not even stop the car or make you live more carefully. Near the check point we stop talking, you let the hands rub your clothes against your body. You seem to be there, all there. Watching, I am more apart for the sign of dismissal they will give me, thinking a woman would not conceal as I have, the perfect map of this return where I have met and lost you willingly in a dead and living place. Now when you find me next in the dream, this boundary will move with us. We will both come back.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Someone to follow him? I don’t think so. It is like proposing a second heaven as if it were attainable because you played with angels in your childhood and believed in the wings of their flesh. A young girl strokes the tight braids of her hair and thinks she is one memory. A little eye gleams in the moonlight hoping to be freed of its love of water, of foggy nights, of wings, tangled in the hair of celestial heads. I would die again for that girl who received everything the world suggested as if each moment were an ascension. But I have used up my deaths in loving him as he died. And if this new love ends it will have to go on in me like a mountain behind a town when the mountain is made to watch that town enter flames and smoke until it at last resembles the essence of love, that impersonation of his heart’s heart which, one day in the girl’s second memory, became a little eye in moonlight where he lived in her, imperishable as anything offered to coexist with the unreplaceable.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There are the few we hear of like Christ, who, with divine grace, made goodness look easy, had a following to draw near, gave up the right things and saw to it that sinners got listened to. Sharpening my failures, I remember the Jains, the gentle swoosh of their brooms on a dirt path trodden by children and goats, each thoughtful step taken in peril of an ant’s life or a fat grub hidden under a stick. In the car-wash, thinking of yogis under a tree plucking hair by hair the head of an initiate, I feel at least elsewhere those able for holiness— its signs and rigors—are at work. Ignominiously, I am here, brushes clamped, soap and water pulsing against my car. (A good sign too, those asylums for old and diseased animals.) My car is clean and no one has had to lift a finger. The dead bugs have been gushed away into a soup of grit and foam—the evidence not subterranean, not streaming along the asphalt in sunlight so dazzling I attend the birth-moment of the word Hosannah! I care about the bugs and not in this life will I do enough towards my own worth in the memory of them. I appreciate the Jains, their atonements for my neglect, though I understand it makes poor farmers of them, and good we all don’t aspire to such purity so there’s somebody heartless enough to plow the spuds. Early on in admiration, I put off knowledge, and so delayed reading about the Jains—not to lose solace. But in the County Library, turning a page, I meet them as the wealthiest moneylenders in Western India. Reading on, I’m encouraged—the list of virtues exceeds vices—just four of those: anger, pride, illusion and greed. The emphasis clearly on striving. I write them down in the corner of a map of Idaho: forbearance, indulgence, straightforwardness, purity, veracity, restraint, freedom from attachment to anything, poverty and chastity. Choosing, getting into the car to get to the supermarket, hearing over engine noise the bright agonies of birds, the radio news with the child nailed into a broom-closet for twenty-four hours by parents who in straightforwardness sacrificed forbearance, I feel a longing for religion, for doctrine swift as a broom to keep the path clear. Later, alone in the kitchen with the groceries, I read the list again. Overwhelmed by the loneliness of the saints, I take up my broom and begin where I stand, with linoleum.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I have had to write this down in my absence and yours. These things happen. Thinking of a voice added I imagine a sympathy outside us that protects the message from what can’t help, being said. The times you’ve kept your secret, putting on glasses or glancing into a page with interest, give again the hurt you’ve forgiven, pretending to be one of us. So the hope of love translates as a series of hidden moments where we like to think someone was fooled into it. Who was I then who filled these days with illegible warnings: the marriages broken, the land pillaged by speculators, no word for a stranger? This island where I thought the language was mine has left me lonely and innocent as you or that friend who let you copy his themes until the words became pictures of places you would never go. Forgive it then that so much of after depends on these, the words which must find you off the page.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the bath I look up and see the brown moth pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips against the white wall. I heat up the water, running as much hot in as I can stand. These handfuls over my shoulder—how once he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring we were drinking from. Beautiful mischief that stills a moment so I can never look back. Only now, brightest now, and the water never hot enough to drive that shiver out. But I remember solitude—no other presence and each thing what it was. Not this raw fluttering I make of you as you have made of me your watch-fire, your killing light.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
That linkage of warnings sent a tremor through June as if to prepare October in the hardest apples. One week in late July we held hands through the bars of his hospital bed. Our sleep made a canopy over us and it seemed I heard its durable roaring in the companion sleep of what must have been our Bedouin god, and now when the poppy lets go I know it is to lay bare his thickly seeded black coach at the pinnacle of dying. My shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk but grazed on down the hillside, their prayer flags tearing at the void—what we stared into, its cool flux of blue and white. How just shaking at flies they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise of bells braided into their manes. My life simplified to “for him” and his thinned like an injection wearing off so the real gave way to the more-than-real, each moment’s carmine abundance, furl of reddest petals lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black hussar’s hat at the center. By then his breathing stopped so gradually I had to brush lips to know an ending. Tasting then that plush of scarlet which is the last of warmth, kissless kiss he would have given. Mine to extend a lover’s right past its radius, to give and also most needfully, my gallant hussar, to bend and take.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Heartbeat trembling your kingdom of leaves near the ceremony of water, I never insisted on you. I admit I delayed. I was the Empress of Delay. But it can’t be put off now. On the sacred branch of my only voice – I insist. Insist for us all, which is the job of the voice, and especially of the poet. Else what am I for, what use am I if I don’t insist? There are messages to send. Gatherings and songs. Because we need to insist. Else what are we for? What use are we?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Not the one he’s wearing in that stopped length of ground, but the one we saw together in the little shop in Oregon—moss agate so green it was nearly black on its silver band. Hard to come across it after, emptied of his hand and watchful. Thinking to surprise its power with treason, I gave it to our friend who wore no rings and needed its luck. But soon I knew, don’t ask me how, the ring lay among lesser things in a drawer. I asked for it back, and for a while, wore it on a chain around my neck. But it was awkward like a high-school charm, the sign of love a girl outgrows—not as it was, exchanged for the rose-gold of wedding bands. Where is it now? In some abject safety. But where? Put away. I turn the house upside down searching. Not to find it—worse than omen. Like happiness squandered in fountains with wrongheaded wishing. Or the hit-and-miss taunt of memory, its dulled signature so casual it crushes me lucid and I believe what I don’t believe in the way of true apparitions—that he uses my longing to call himself to me, that my senses are inhabited like the log into which a bear has crawled to dream winter a way, that the ongoing presence of the dead is volatile, sacramental. The wind he’s attached to—that boy, running with a kite over the gravestones, looking up, keeping his footing as if he worked sky into the earth with a cool boldness. So the dead-aliveness of my love turns in the flux of memory, of what his memory would recall, as he is recalled to a street in Oregon, dead and alive in love, with the strangeness of cold silver close around the finger on his new-made hand.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I was walking through a vast darkness in a dress studded with diamonds, the cloth under them like chain mail—metallic, form fitting like the sea to its horizon. I could hear waves breaking on the shore and far off concertina music drifting over the dunes. What was I doing in high heels in sand in a diamond-studded dress that had to be stolen? Fear washed through me, as if one of those waves had risen up and, against all the rules of waves, splashed me from the shoulders down. I was wet with diamonds and fear. A small boat held offshore with its cold yellow light pointing a long watery finger at me while the stolen feeling of the dress sparkled my location out into the universe. Thief! Thief! came an interplanetary cry, causing me to gaze up into the star-brilliant firmament, for it wasn’t just a sky anymore. It had taken on biblical stature. How had I gotten into this dress, these unruly waves, this queasy feeling I would be found out? Time to run! my heart said, pumping away under its brocade of diamonds. Strange vacancies had accumulated after all my sleep-plundered nights. Thief! came the cry again, as if I should recognize myself. And I did. I flung those high heels into the depths, took up my newfound identity, and without the least remorse, began to run those diamonds right out of this world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The sleep of this night deepens because I have walked coatless from the house carrying the white envelope. All night it will say one name in its little tin house by the roadside. I have raised the metal flag so its shadow under the roadlamp leaves an imprint on the rain-heavy bushes. Now I will walk back thinking of the few lights still on in the town a mile away. In the yellowed light of a kitchen the millworker has finished his coffee, his wife has laid out the white slices of bread on the counter. Now while the bed they have left is still warm, I will think of you, you who are so far away you have caused me to look up at the stars. Tonight they have not moved from childhood, those games played after dark. Again I walk into the wet grass toward the starry voices. Again, I am the found one, intimate, returned by all I touch on the way.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I get up he has been long at work, his brush limber against the house. Seeing him on his ladder under the eaves, I look back on myself asleep in the dream I could not carry awake. Sleep inside a house that is being painted, whole lifetimes now only the familiar cast of morning light over the prayer plant. This “not remembering” is something new of where you have been. What was settled or unsettled in sleep stays there. But your house under this steady arm is leaving itself and you see this gradual surface of new light covering your sleep has the greater power. You think now you felt brush strokes or the space between them, a motion bearing down on you—accumulation of stars, each night of them arranging over the roofs of entire cities. His careful strokes whiten the web, the swirl of woodgrain blotted out like a breath stopped at the heart. Nothing has changed you say, faithlessly. But something has cleansed you past recognition. When you stand near his ladder looking up he does not acknowledge you, and as from daylight in a dream you see your house has passed from you into the blessed hands of others. This is ownership, you think, arriving in the heady afterlife of paint smell. A deep opening goes on in you. Some paint has dropped onto your shoulder as though light concealed an unsuspected weight. You think it has fallen through you. You think you have agreed to this, what has been done with your life, willingly.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If I could begin anything I’d say stop asking forgiveness, especially theirs which was always the fault mentioned in your condition. Nettles could be feathers the moment they brush your ankle. At the same time: floods, earthquakes, the various slaveries hunchbacked near the fence to catch your glance. What is it to say that among the hired boats we carried our bodies well, cracked jokes, left the gaps in our lives and not the page? This far to learn the boat does not touch the water! And if this is goodbye, it is a light nowhere near believing and I am happy and it is all right to make a distance of a nearness, to say, ‘Boat, I have left you behind. Boat, I am with you.’@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Growing a bear — a midnight occupation, the need for which you perhaps first realizedwhen you saw the wrong kind of shadow under your chin — a convex when you expectedconcave, so now it’s clearyou’re getting older. Your wife was in the showerand you wanted to step insideand soap her up like you did in college when she said“I’ll shower with you, but I’m leavingmy underwear on,” and you enjoyed herin every way you could enjoy a person with soap.You didn’t join your wife in the shower.She’s gotten funny about letting you see hershave her legs or wash herself anywhere.You think she read it somewhere — that letting your husband see you pluck anything,trim anything, apply medicine to anything,will make him feel like he’s furniture.It’s exactly on cold nights like these that the basementis not as forbidding as it should be, despite the factthat you have to put gloves on in what is part of your own home.Downstairs, a large bathtub, kept, for some reason,after remodeling. It is there that your bear will be grown,by you, though you have no idea how. Probably wishingis most of it; fertilizer, chunks of raw stew meat,handfuls of blackberries, two metal rakes, and a thick rugmake up the rest. Then water.You get an e-mail from a friend late at night saying he can’t sleep. You write back “I hope you feel sleepy soon” and think how childish the word “sleepy” is. And you’re a man,older than most of the people you see on television.You haven’t even considered how your wife will feelwhen you have finished growing your bear. You could write a letter to her tonight, explaining how your lifewas just so lacking in bear: “Janet, it’s nothing you’ve done — clearly you have no possible way of supplying me with a bearor any of the activities I might be able to enjoy after acquiring the bear.” It might just be best to keep the two worlds separate. Janet clearly prefers things to be comfortableand unchallenging. Janet soaps herself up. Janet puts herselfto bed, and you just happen to be next to her. You go on your weekly bike ride with Mark and tell himthat you’ve been growing a bear. An eighteen-wheeler flies by and he doesn’t seem to hear you — plus he’s focused on the hill. You think about how not all friends knowwhat each other sounds like when struggling andbreathing heavy. Past the age of college athletics,most friends don’t even know what each others’ bodieslook like, flushed, tired, showering, cold.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I wanted to make myself like the ravineso that all good thingswould flow into me.Because the ravine is lowly,it receives an abundance.This sounds wonderfulto everyonewho suffers from lacking,but consider, too, that a ravinekeeps nothing out:in flows a peachwith only one bite taken out of it,but in flows, too,the body of a stiff mousehalf cooked by the heat of the stoveit was toughening under.I have an easygoing way about me.I’ve been an inviting host —meaning to, not meaning to.Oops — he’s approaching with his tonguealready out and moving.Analyze the risksof becoming a ravine.Compare those with the risksof becoming a wellwith a well-bolted lid.Which I’d preferdepends largely on which kindsof animals were inside mewhen the lid went onand how likely they’d beto enjoy the water,vs. drown, freeze, or starve.The lesson: close yourself offat exactly the right time.On the day that you wake upunder some yellow curtainswith a smile on your face,lock the door. Live out your daysuntroubled like that.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It had a secret name which in later years came to meanI will continue to stand here. It had a food mouth and a shrieking mouth. Popular wisdom indicated that Its hands could heat stones and that a man could cook meat on those stones. That being said, It had a poverty hand and a riches hand. They were the same hand. A little ways above the hands the mouths spoke together but for two different reasons, like the music was behaving but the orchestra was broken. * Even in less benevolent moments, It was known to use Its own body as a tent and as the gifts inside of the tent. Early people said It had a mother hand and a father hand, and that together they made a clapping sound. Its hands delivered the children from madness. The hands saw the riverbank sliding into the river to make a more shallow river. They scooped the mud up. The hands were giving thanks. * The hands smelled like exodus. The hands were the law. One hand grew older, and the other hand younger. They said, fairly often,We’d like to try that again. Both were restless and wanted rest. One hand said, I will go where you go, while the other hand continued on alone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My house disgusted me, so I slept in a tent. My tent disgusted me, so I slept in the grass. The grass disgusted me, so I slept in my body, which I strung like a hammock from two ropes. My body disgusted me, so I carved myself out of it. My use of knives disgusted me because it was an act of violence. My weakness disgusted me because “Hannah” means “hammer.” The meaning of my name disgusted me because I’d rather be known as beautiful. My vanity disgusted me because I am a scholar. My scholarship disgusted me because knowledge is empty. My emptiness disgusted me because I wanted to be whole. My wholeness would have disgusted me because to be whole is to be smug. Still, I tried to understand wholeness as the inclusiveness of all activities: I walked out into the yard, trying to vomit and drink milk simultaneously. I tried to sleep while smoking a cigar. I have enough regrets to crack all the plumbing. I’m whole only in that I’ve built my person from every thought I’ve ever loved.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Most people would rather not,but I indulge, every few weeks,the thought of it. Sometimesthe oily smell of an evening flower appearsand hangs in the air, a slightly browner spot.I think most people had it wrong when they saidforget about it and find a fresh patch of grass to lie down in. There are prayers, though,about that kind of peace. I have to admit, sometimesI want nothing more than to be lying on the bottomof an unimpressive river. I can watch all the leaves and sticks skim over my head,and no one will bother me because they’re swimmingin the more impressive rivers.The water’s not too cold. It doesn’t feellike being dead.It also doesn’t feel like being oldor fetal.I came to the humble water to lie down.I did what I set out to do.Now I don’t have to tell youanything more about it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It’s too cold to smoke outside, but if you come over, I’ll keep my hands to myself, or won’t I. I would like to tell you about the wall eaten up by the climbing plant—it was so beautiful. Various things have been happening to me, all of them sexual. The man on the bus took off his pants so I could see him better. Another man said, “Ignore him darlin’. Just sit on my lap.” But I’m not one of those who’s hungriest in the morning, unlike the man at the bakery who eats egg after egg after egg. Listen. Come over: the cold has already eaten the summer. I need another pair of ears: from the kitchen I can’t tell if I’m hearing wind chimes or some gray woman with failing arms dropping a pan full of onions and potatoes. This morning I need four hands— two to wash the greens, one to lift a teakettle, one to pour the milk. This morning, one little mouth will not do. We could play a game where we crouch on the tiles, two yellow dogs drinking coffee from bowls. We could play a game where we let the breakfast burn. Outside there’s a world where every love scene begins with a man in a doorway; he walks over to the woman and says “Open your mouth.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The thick-walled room’s cave-darkness, cool in summer, soothes by saying, This is the truth, not the taut cicada-strummed daylight. Rest here, out of the flame—the thick air’s stirred by the fan’s four slow-moving spoons; under the house the stone has its feet in deep water. Outside, even the sun god, dressed in this life as a lizard, abruptly rises on stiff legs and descends blasé toward the shadows.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Standing, leaning, with both long- clawed paws she rips punk wood out of a tree with a high hollow to get at her cause inside—her sharp brute parentheses tear at the living humming word. The honey the tree has helped the bees hide has drawn her near with its scent. Forcing the issue, she’s heavy, off-balance, intent. Flying defenders of the sweet they’ve produced and on which they and their larvae depend, the bees swarm her nose, her eyes, her tongue, her plan, often they trace with their hovering the lying-down eight of infinity before they sting and fall mortally self-wounded. Yet always in this valor they fail to defend—and who can succeed?— the whole history of poetry.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Down in the blue-green water at nightfall some selving shapes float fluorescing, trance-dancing, trembling to the rhythm of theodoxical marching- music that they hear over the mere noise of the breaking tide. Above, stars in certain places; along the shore roads, cars carrying people on uncertain errands, sordid and sacred and all the kinds in between. Halogen-lit, a woman gets down from her all-wheel-drive velocipede, enters through an obeying door a cyclopean store to buy unintelligent fresh fish and other objects whether formerly alive or formerly dead, she comes out again, a poor man calls to her, selling his no-news- paper; the disastrous head- lines smile and nod, they announce the plans of steel patriots and undertakers, ad-men and fallen vice-generals, doping their stolen crusades. But the woman has learned, as I have learned, as all of us must keep learning if we are to be good subjects, how to make of a newspaper the mask of a locust, calmly put it on, and begin once more to eat everything up.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Imagining, on a long walk between two Greek towns, those Turkish prisoners the guidebook says were sabred where they crowded together on the stone dock; and then imagining—still walking, anxious to see some worker in the fields or another old couple like the last one (he riding the donkey, she leading it in black)— the Greeks whom the Germans shot; and as the road after rising leads down again, at last to the town by the bay, imagining all the feuds given license by the civil war, the woman whose husband, forgive him his faults now, steps dead through the doorway one night: imagining, imagining—is there a way out of this brooding ahead to the hollow thud of the first dirt thrown down on his coffin? What is the word any tongue can make good for the boy— let someone else name his country— who speaks to his sleeping wife when he leaves at night, his brother tagging after him, one puny gun between them? If his cold spirit can still speak her name tomorrow, won’t she feel even more alone? Aeneas carried a high purpose on the point of his sword: a city needed founding, if not here then in another place. This road, though, dips past two ordinary houses and then the disco casting a stale abandoned shade, sharp-edged, to one side, and I descend— through hot odd-angled streets lined with those plane trees whose name’s so bland and awkward translated out of sunny Greek or Spanish— to the huge white plane-tree-shaded square. At the cafe in the open air I order lemonade from the waitress who has just served the little table crowded round by seven or eight, a changing group—the eager interpreter talking and listening at the same time, three young women dressed up, and even in this small town the four military men from the foreign ship offshore, out of uniform but with an apparent eye for swag some future day, talking of small deals, clever braveries, travels. They exact smiles and attentions and never have they seen such a pretty town as this, never. The three women listen hard to the roared harsh sounds of the odd tongue, then impatiently to the interpreter while the military men wait. What could such noise be about? Do these men love the ways ours do, do they like their women to speak to them in bed, to say what they want, to say it? The Turkish prisoners had been led outside with the lie that they’d be freed. Inside the smoky small bar so they can watch without being watched, young men are bitter, imagining the weight of medals, coming one by one to the dusty window-glass then returning toward the far unlit interior. The lemonade arrives at last in the pretty hands of the waitress, she puts it on my white table under the plane trees and hurries away to be near the laughing group, foreign men who one day may bring something new to the town, or something old. for Gloria@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Something needs to be done—like dragging a big black plastic sack through the upstairs rooms, emptying into it each waste basket, the trash of three lives for a week or so. I am careful and slow about it, so that this little chore will banish the big ones. But I leave the bag lying on the floor and I go into my daughter’s bedroom, into the north morning light from her windows, and while this minute she is at school counting or spelling a first useful word I sit down on her unmade bed and I look out the windows at nothing for a while, the unmoving buildings—houses and a church—in the cold street. Across it a dark young man is coming slowly down the white sidewalk with a snowshovel over his shoulder. He’s wearing a light coat, there’s a plastic showercap under his dirty navy blue knit hat, and at a house where the walk hasn’t been cleared he climbs the steps and rings the doorbell and stands waiting, squinting sideways at the wind. Then he half wakes and he says a few words I can’t hear to the storm door that doesn’t open, and he nods his head with the kindly farewell that is a habit he wears as disguise, and he goes back down the steps and on to the next house. All of this in pantomime, the way I see it through windows closed against winter and the faint sounds of winter. My daughter’s cross-eyed piggy bank is also staring out blankly, and in its belly are four dollar bills that came one at a time from her grandmother and which tomorrow she will pull out of the corked mouthhole. (It’s not like the piggy banks you have to fill before you empty them because to empty them you have to smash them.) Tomorrow she will buy a perfect piece of small furniture for her warm well-lit dollhouse where no one is tired or weak and the wind can’t get in. Sitting on her bed, looking out, I didn’t see a bundled-up lame child out of school and even turned out of the house for a while, or a blind woman with burns or a sick bald veteran—people who might have walked past stoop-shouldered with what’s happened and will keep happening to them. So much limping is not from physical pain—the pain is gone now, but the leg’s still crooked. The piggy bank and I see only the able young man whose straight back nobody needs. When he finally gets past where I can see him, it feels as if a kind of music has stopped, and it’s more completely quiet than it was, an emptiness more than a stillness, and I get up from the rumpled bed and I smooth the covers, slowly and carefully, and I look around the room for something to pick up or straighten, and I take a wadded dollar bill from my pocket and put it into the pig and I walk out.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Sleepless in the cold dark, I look through the closed dim door be- fore me, which be- comes an abyss into which my memories have fallen past laughter or horror, passion or hard work—my memories of our past laughter, horror, passion, hard work. An ache of be- ing. An ache of being, over love. An ache of being over love. Like projections on the screen of the heavy window curtains, flashing lights of a slow-scraping after- midnight snowplow for a moment pulse in this room.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The loop of rusty cable incises its shadow on the stucco wall. My father smiles shyly and takes one of my cigarettes, holding it awkwardly at first, as if it were a dart, while the yard slowly swings across the wide sill of daylight. Then it is a young man’s quick hand that rises to his lips, he leans against the wall, his white shirt open at the throat, where the skin is weathered, and he chats and daydreams, something he never does. Smoking his cigarette, he is even younger than I am, a brother who begins to guess, amazed, that what he will do will turn out to be this. He recalls the house he had when I was born, leaning against it now after work, the pale stucco of memory, 1947. Baby bottles stand near the sink inside. The new wire of the telephone, dozing in a coil, waits for the first call. The years are smoke.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A last formality is running late, as a life can't, this hot day. The final ethereal glow of the sun seems to come up from underfoot in this parkland of polysyllabic death. These deep graves, two this time, neatly cut into the earth, await the arrivals, and two adjacent heaps of damp fertile glebe are half blanketed by reticent dark tarpaulins. After the full moon's first moments of horizon-magnified fact and risen largesse, it has contracted as our heaven has passed it by and now it floats above the crowns of the inky trees and well beyond bare roofs. It has always been an entity born dead—not a phantom, as must be this son, a muddy part of whom soared from cratered waste lands far away before landing here, and also this veteran father, whose heart staggered into an ER and failed after he heard what circumstance had done to his one boy. No horses—hearses, the first two cars. A corps of six men— they bear the heavy coffined corpse of the father toward his very small opening in the planet; and six more envoys of duty, with much-practiced attentiveness, slow-step the light son, an imperfect cadaver with handles, to his own last place. White gloves lift up the draped famed cloth, super-striped and starry, from the younger casket, fold it just so— hands with hands over hands in ritual honor, a ceremony neither of mystical creed nor of doubter's midnights—then they advance it to the one who remains. She's looking away from her burials, down at the blades of moon grass. She feels no great gut blows from startled convulsive big drums that shake the spirits of mourners, nor any whirring of equally perilous small drums that might reduce the silence. The son is submitted as lifeless organism to dirt; the father’s remains descend into his pit alongside, likewise on tightly held ropes men slowly let slip. (In foremost ranks of a final unbecoming these two fell alike.) The ropes snake back up into what's left of natural light— remainder of the ancient calculus of day and night. From a boom box ten paces away, the familiar bugled notes say that the journey of these remains is done. Even if no grief shadows the bugler, bugles do sound it, word it—that unacceptable sentence of slow notes. Distant, on overtime, respectful, yet much too near, a stranger waits to start up a backhoe. On such occasions, after courage of soldiers or folly of command or cold wrong purposes among patriarchs, lords, kings, and freed madness in red valleys, mountains, cities, villages, in schools, shrines, sheds, beds, mud-brick hearts, we have offered up our mortally wounded, un- comprehending remembrance. We look down or away and notice the impassive grass under our bloody weight.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The children are eating lunch at home on a summer weekday when a man comes to the door and asks their mother if she has anything that needs fixing or carrying or any yardwork he can do. They chew their food a little dreamily as, with her back straight and her voice carefully polite, she says No, thank you, I’m sorry, and the man goes away. Who was that, Mama? they say. Oh, no one, she says. They are sitting down to dinner but they have to wait because the doorbell rings and a thin young boy begins to tell their father about a Sales Program he’s completing for a scholarship to be Supervisor, and he holds up a filthy tattered little booklet and lifts also his desperate guile and heavily guarded hope, and the children’s father says, No thank you, sorry but I can’t help you out this time, and the boy goes away. The children start to eat and don’t ask anything, because the boy was just a boy, but their father acts irritated and hasty when he sits back down. Once a glassy-eyed heavy girl who almost seems asleep as she stands outside their door offers for sale some little handtowels stitched by the blind people at the Lighthouse for the Blind and the children are in the folds of their mother’s full skirt listening to the girl’s small voice and their mother says, Well, I bought some the last time. She buys the children school supplies and food, she pays the two boys for mowing the yard together and weeding her flower bed. She gets a new sewing machine for her birthday from the children’s father, and she buys fabric and thread and patterns and makes dresses for the girls, to save money. She tells the children each to put a dime or quarter into the collection plate at Church, and once a month she puts in a little sealed white envelope, and the ushers move slowly along the ends of the pews weaving the baskets through the congregation, and the organist plays a long piece of music. Whisk brooms, magazine subscriptions, anything you need hauled away, little league raffle tickets, cookies, chocolate candy, can I do any yard work again and again, hairbrushes, Christmas cards, do you need help with your ironing one time, and more, came calling at the front door while the children were sometimes eating, sometimes playing. Their faces would soften with a kind of comfort in the authority of mother or father, with a kind of wonder at the needy callers. Their father left for work every day early, and came home for dinner, and almost always went again on Saturday; in his car. Their mother opened a savings account for each child and into each put the first five dollars. The children felt proud to see their names in the passbooks, and wanted to know when they could take the money out. But they were told they had to save their money not spend it. They felt a kind of pleasure in these mysteries, to know that there were things you would understand later when you grew up and had your own house and while your children were eating their dinner and making too much noise the way you did, you knew it was true, the doorbell would ring, the familiar surprise of it, who would it be, and someone would be holding a little worn book or a bundle of dishtowels or once an old man, but perhaps he only looked old, with his beard, came with bunches of carnations, white, red, and pink, and he too was turned away.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Someone has left us now before we have even touched hands. Getting lost in the pity of it sweeps you into an unknown stretch of canyon where oars thud against rock and rip free, you clutch at help, and even though you save yourself, the river funnels through the gorge and roars, roars, roars. Regret, a backwash of pain, one lost life swirls down rapids, rushes away, out of reach. It’s not forgetting that you want — it would be easy to drop one shoulder and dive, to come up gasping in a car on the way to work or blue in the face over the dishpan staring for who knows how long at a cup scoured clean under the suds. And not remembering. But the absence that is born must live as long as a man or a woman. There: it comes invisible headfirst, a bloodstreaked nothing, and is flushed away. While in the white room the dry light is cold; and waiting to be taken home mute ghosts lie in a row of empty cribs.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Where moonlight angles through the east-west streets, down among the old for America tall buildings that changed the streets of other cities circulate elevated trains overhead shrieking and drumming, lit by explosions of sparks that harm no one and the shadowed persons walking underneath the erratic waves not of the lake but of noise move through fog sieved by the steel mesh of the supporting structures or through rain that rinses pavements and the el platforms or through new snow that quiets corners, moods, riveted careers. Working for others with hands, backs, machines, men built hard towers that part the high air, women and men built, cooked, cleaned, delivered, typed and filed, carried and delivered, priced and sold. The river and air were filthy. In a hundred years builders would migrate north a mile but in these modern times this was all the downtown that was. And circling on a round-cornered rectangle of tracks run the trains, clockwise and counter, veering through or loop-the-loop and out again. Why even try to list the kinds of places men and women made to make money? Not enough of them, yet too many. From slow trains overhead some passengers can still see stone ornaments, pilasters, lintels, carved by grandfathers, great uncles and gone second cousins of today—gargoyle heads and curving leaves, like memorials for that which was built to be torn down again someday, for those who got good wages out of all this building or were broken by it, or both, yet whose labor preserves a record of labor, imagination, ambition, skill, greed, folly, error, cost, story, so that a time before remains present within the bright careening now.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My father came down not killed from among others, killers or killed, for whom he'd worn a uniform, and he lived a long afterward, a steady man on the flattest of plains. I called after him many times, surprised when I heard the catch in my own voice. He didn't know how to find the solace of listening to someone else speak of what he'd seen and survived. He himself closed his own mouth against his own words. In the wrong sequence, his spirit, then his mind, and last his body crossed over that infamous, peat-inky, metaphorical water that has no far shore. I think he was carried like a leaf in currents so gentle that a duckling, had it been alive, could have braved them, but too strong for a leaf. And saturated with minerals that steadily replaced organic cells, the water turned my father, an ex-soldier, to leaf-delicate stone inscribed with the axioms of countless veins.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Coleridge carefully wrote down a whole page of them, all beginning with the letter b. Guidebooks preserve our knowledge of their hues and shapes, their breeding. Many poems have made delicate word-chimes— like wind-chimes not for wind but for the breath of man— out of their lovely names. At the edge of the prairie in a cabin when thunder comes closer to thump the roof hard a few of them—in a corner, brittle in a dry jar where a woman’s thoughtful hand left them to fade— seem to blow with the announcing winds outside as the rain begins to fall on all their supple kin of all colors, under a sky of one color, or none.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A cylinder of maple set in place, feet spread apart— and the heavy maul, fat as a hammer but honed like an axe, draws a semicircle overhead and strikes through the two new halves to leave the steel head sunk a half-inch in the block and the ash handle rigid in the air. A smack of the palm, gripping as it hits the butt end, and the blade rolls out of the cut. The half-logs are still rocking on the flagstones. So much less than what we have been persuaded to dream, this necessity for wood might have sufficed, but it is what we have been taught to disown and forget. Yet just such hardship is what saves. For if the stacked cords speak of felled trees, of countless five-foot logs flipped end over end downhill till the blood is wrung from your back and snowbound warmth must seem so far off you would rather freeze, yet each thin tongue torn from the grain when log-halves were sundered at one stroke will sing in the stove. To remind you of hands. Of how mere touch is song in the silence where hands live—the song of muddy bark, the song of sawdust like cornmeal and down, and the song of one hand over another, two of us holding the last length of the log in the sawbuck as inches away the chainsaw keeps ripping through hickory.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What’s left of my battles and my turmoilis in my seaside cabin: this roiling air.And yet it’s what’s outside that makes me shiver.Not the ocean coldness — something heavier.Hot black tea might help — it revives.Two kinds of glass are at hand for my thirst:that windowpane, this tumbler for my tea.If I stare through the faceted clear sidesof the second at the first,I’ll see the darkness squinting back at me.I can’t deny that even though my eye — clairvoyant as a crystal ball — clinks like it can seesomething, I don’t know what comes next ... (Zek — zek — whetstones on knives ... a nickering ... Here comes a horse, it whinniesand the rider — Stick him!, thieves shoutas they leap down from a tree and stab,then they lead the horse awaydown the long snowbound shore.)Windswept snow and sand are sorrel: tea leavesscalded by sunset. Sea foam rushes up these shoresto decorate some fir trees but not others.And on the withers of a wave a gull-equestrian comes riding in — Haie! Here they both are!Snow explodes like sugarthat someone is stabbing with a spoonin a glass of chai.And the tea-air sweetens, the snow-sand dissolves,the light of it switched off, spent, an omen:now look — from deep within the firmamentTime has bobbed up like the moon: the clock face of a slice of lemon. I clink the teaspoon in the glass — what’s that about?And even though each hourly radiusof the lemon slice is fixed in the white rind,between these translucencies pressed pulp spills out.Like lime or lemon, the taste of Time is sour — and yet it has no odor, color, hour.My clinking teaspoon’s yet another ofmy self-delusions, since it’s only the glassthat answers it, and Timesays nothing in reply — like all the other governingsthat invite us to believethey have their power over us.In every object, quick or dead, there’s Time,yet Time itself is unaware of Time — the way a gull (such a polyglotof fish-tongues), soaring in the dark,unknowingly glows at ten to two,her wings the phosphorescent hands of a clock.No people in this region. But — do peopleexist at all? And the so-called base and superstructureget, at best, a grade of C (in Russian, “three,”troika — a kind of carriage — in which the Uriah Heepsare riding toward our “bright new future” ... ).Oh, plenty of hearty pink-faced people (gray-faced, too)here ... but are they that real? There’s only sea and tidesand more of the same. Sea air throws bombastat my cabin and makes it talk.My window’s blinded by a heavy foamy sea-pulp blast.At the bottom of my tea glass — sweetest sweet.But sugar specks are stuck to the sides,scarcely rinsed by waves of tea,whether attacked or not by my spoon.Now come the many stars that the sky is, or was — like the American flag on the moon — but under such a sky, who feels he needs Kant’s categorical imperative? So Time is always empty, a negative,and doesn’t bother us the way this landscape does. I could have sparkled like a Cicero!But even out here all words are turned into a gameof ping-pong, which makes my silenced braincome bubbling out my throat — it’s just one more white foam ... And only an insatiable gull’s scream of dissentmarks this deaf land not as the island of a castaway but as a massive continent. Translated from the Russian@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I am the Angel with the Broken Wing,The one large statue in this quiet room.The staff finds me too fierce, and so they shutFaith’s ardor in this air-conditioned tomb.The docents praise my elegant designAbove the chatter of the gallery.Perhaps I am a masterpiece of sorts—The perfect emblem of futility.Mendoza carved me for a country church.(His name’s forgotten now except by me.)I stood beside a gilded altar whereThe hopeless offered God their misery.I heard their women whispering at my feet—Prayers for the lost, the dying, and the dead.Their candles stretched my shadow up the wall,And I became the hunger that they fed.I broke my left wing in the Revolution(Even a saint can savor irony)When troops were sent to vandalize the chapel.They hit me once—almost apologetically.For even the godless feel something in a church,A twinge of hope, fear? Who knows what it is?A trembling unaccounted by their laws,An ancient memory they can’t dismiss.There are so many things I must tell God!The howling of the dammed can’t reach so high.But I stand like a dead thing nailed to a perch,A crippled saint against a painted sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Stand in a field long enough, and the sounds start up again. The crickets, the invisible toad who claims that change is possible, And all the other life too small to name. First one, then another, until innumerable they merge into the single voice of a summer hill. Yes, it’s hard to stand still, hour after hour, fixed as a fencepost, hearing the steers snort in the dark pasture, smelling the manure. And paralyzed by the mystery of how a stone can bear to be a stone, the pain the grass endures breaking through the earth’s crust. Unimaginable the redwoods on the far hill, rooted for centuries, the living wood grown tall and thickened with a hundred thousand days of light. The old windmill creaks in perfect time to the wind shaking the miles of pasture grass, and the last farmhouse light goes off. Something moves nearby. Coyotes hunt these hills and packs of feral dogs. But standing here at night accepts all that. You are your own pale shadow in the quarter moon, moving more slowly than the crippled stars, part of the moonlight as the moonlight falls, Part of the grass that answers the wind, part of the midnight’s watchfulness that knows there is no silence but when danger comes.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I can imagine someone who found these fields unbearable, who climbed the hillside in the heat, cursing the dust, cracking the brittle weeds underfoot, wishing a few more trees for shade. An Easterner especially, who would scorn the meagerness of summer, the dry twisted shapes of black elm, scrub oak, and chaparral, a landscape August has already drained of green. One who would hurry over the clinging thistle, foxtail, golden poppy, knowing everything was just a weed, unable to conceive that these trees and sparse brown bushes were alive. And hate the bright stillness of the noon without wind, without motion, the only other living thing a hawk, hungry for prey, suspended in the blinding, sunlit blue. And yet how gentle it seems to someone raised in a landscape short of rain— the skyline of a hill broken by no more trees than one can count, the grass, the empty sky, the wish for water.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
“Poetry must lead somewhere,” declared Breton. He carried a rose inside his coat each day to give a beautiful stranger—“Better to die of love than love without regret.” And those who loved him soon learned regret. “The simplest surreal act is running through the street with a revolver firing at random.” Old and famous, he seemed démodé. There is always a skeleton on the buffet. Wounded Apollinaire wore a small steel plate inserted in his skull. “I so loved art,” he smiled, “I joined the artillery.” His friends were asked to wait while his widow laid a crucifix across his chest. Picasso hated death. The funeral left him so distressed he painted a self-portrait. “It's always other people,” remarked Duchamp, “who do the dying.” I came. I sat down. I went away. Dali dreamed of Hitler as a white-skinned girl— impossibly pale, luminous and lifeless as the moon. Wealthy Roussel taught his poodle to smoke a pipe. “When I write, I am surrounded by radiance. My glory is like a great bomb waiting to explode.” When his valet refused to slash his wrists, the bankrupt writer took an overdose of pills. There is always a skeleton on the buffet. Breton considered suicide the truest art, though life seemed hardly worth the trouble to discard. The German colonels strolled the Île de la Cité— some to the Louvre, some to the Place Pigalle. “The loneliness of poets has been erased,” cried Éluard, in praise of Stalin. “Burn all the books,” said dying Hugo Ball. There is always a skeleton on the buffet. I came. I sat down. I went away.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
“We're going,” they said, “to the end of the world.” So they stopped the car where the river curled, And we scrambled down beneath the bridge On the gravel track of a narrow ridge. We tramped for miles on a wooded walk Where dog-hobble grew on its twisted stalk. Then we stopped to rest on the pine-needle floor While two ospreys watched from an oak by the shore. We came to a bend, where the river grew wide And green mountains rose on the opposite side. My guides moved back. I stood alone, As the current streaked over smooth flat stone. Shelf by stone shelf the river fell. The white water goosetailed with eddying swell. Faster and louder the current dropped Till it reached a cliff, and the trail stopped. I stood at the edge where the mist ascended, My journey done where the world ended. I looked downstream. There was nothing but sky, The sound of the water, and the water’s reply.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Turning the corner, we discovered it just as the old wrought-iron lamps went on— a quiet, tree-lined street, only one block long resting between the noisy avenues. The streetlamps splashed the shadows of the leaves across the whitewashed brick, and each tall window glowing through the ivy-decked facade promised lives as perfect as the light. Walking beneath the trees, we counted all the high black doors of houses bolted shut. And yet we could have opened any door, entered any room the evening offered. Or were we deluded by the strange equations of the light, the vagrant wind searching the trees, that we believed this brief conjunction of our separate lives was real? It seemed that moment lingered like a ghost, a flicker in the air, smaller than a moth, a curl of smoke flaring from a match, haunting a world it could not touch or hear. There should have been a greeting or a sign, the smile of a stranger, something beyond the soft refusals of the summer air and children trading secrets on the steps. Traffic bellowed from the avenue. Our shadows moved across the street’s long wall, and at the end what else could I have done but turn the corner back into my life?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The dead say little in their letters they haven't said before. We find no secrets, and yet how different every sentence sounds heard across the years. My father breaks my heart simply by being so young and handsome. He's half my age, with jet-black hair. Look at him in his navy uniform grinning beside his dive-bomber. Come back, Dad! I want to shout. He says he misses all of us (though I haven't yet been born). He writes from places I never knew he saw, and everyone he mentions now is dead. There is a large, long photograph curled like a diploma—a banquet sixty years ago. My parents sit uncomfortably among tables of dark-suited strangers. The mildewed paper reeks of regret. I wonder what song the band was playing, just out of frame, as the photographer arranged your smiles. A waltz? A foxtrot?Get out there on the floor and dance! You don't have forever. What does it cost to send a postcard to the underworld? I'll buy a penny stamp from World War II and mail it downtown at the old post office just as the courthouse clock strikes twelve. Surely the ghost of some postal worker still makes his nightly rounds, his routine too tedious for him to notice when it ended. He works so slowly he moves back in time carrying our dead letters to their lost addresses. It's silly to get sentimental. The dead have moved on. So should we. But isn't it equally simple-minded to miss the special expertise of the departed in clarifying our long-term plans? They never let us forget that the line between them and us is only temporary.Get out there and dance! the letters shout adding, Love always. Can't wait to get home! And soon we will be. See you there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I was already an old man when I was born. Small with a curved back, he dragged his leg when walking the streets of Copenhagen. \"Little Kierkegaard,” they called him. Some meant it kindly. The more one suffersthe more one acquires a sense of the comic. His hair rose in waves six inches above his head.Save me, O God, from ever becoming sure. What good is faith if it is not irrational? Christianity requires a conviction of sin. As a boy tending sheep on the frozen heath, his starving father cursed God for his cruelty. His fortunes changed. He grew rich and married well. His father knew these blessings were God's punishment. All would be stripped away. His beautiful wife died, then five of his children. Crippled Soren survived.The self-consuming sickness unto death is despair. What the age needs is not a genius but a martyr. Soren fell in love, proposed, then broke the engagement. No one, he thought, could bear his presence daily.My sorrow is my castle. His books were read but ridiculed. Cartoons mocked his deformities His private journals fill seven thousand pages. You could read them all, he claimed, and still not know him.He who explains this riddle explains my life. When everyone is Christian, Christianitydoes not exist. The crowd is untruth. Rememberwe stand alone before God in fear and trembling. At forty-two he collapsed on his daily walk. Dying he seemed radiant. His skin had become almost transparent. He refused communion from the established church. His grave has no headstone.Now with God's help I shall at last become myself.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
California night. The Devil’s wind, the Santa Ana, blows in from the east, raging through the canyon like a drunk screaming in a bar. The air tastes like a stubbed-out cigarette. But why complain? The weather’s fine as long as you don’t breathe. Just lean back on the sweat-stained furniture, lights turned out, windows shut against the storm, and count your blessings. Another sleepless night, when every wrinkle in the bedsheet scratches like a dry razor on a sunburned cheek, when even ten-year whiskey tastes like sand, and quiet women in the kitchen run their fingers on the edges of a knife and eye their husbands’ necks. I wish them luck. Tonight it seems that if I took the coins out of my pocket and tossed them in the air they’d stay a moment glistening like a net slowly falling through dark water. I remember the headlights of the cars parked on the beach, the narrow beams dissolving on the dark surface of the lake, voices arguing about the forms, the crackling radio, the sheeted body lying on the sand, the trawling net still damp beside it. No, she wasn’t beautiful—but at that age when youth itself becomes a kind of beauty— “Taking good care of your clients, Marlowe?” Relentlessly the wind blows on. Next door catching a scent, the dogs begin to howl. Lean, furious, raw-eyed from the storm, packs of coyotes come down from the hills where there is nothing left to hunt.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Now you hear what the house has to say. Pipes clanking, water running in the dark, the mortgaged walls shifting in discomfort, and voices mounting in an endless drone of small complaints like the sounds of a family that year by year you’ve learned how to ignore. But now you must listen to the things you own, all that you’ve worked for these past years, the murmur of property, of things in disrepair, the moving parts about to come undone, and twisting in the sheets remember all the faces you could not bring yourself to love. How many voices have escaped you until now, the venting furnace, the floorboards underfoot, the steady accusations of the clock numbering the minutes no one will mark. The terrible clarity this moment brings, the useless insight, the unbroken dark.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
And in the end, all that is really left Is a feeling—strong and unavoidable— That somehow we deserved something better. That somewhere along the line things Got fouled up. And that letter from whoever’s In charge, which certainly would have set Everything straight between us and the world, Never reached us. Got lost somewhere. Possibly mislaid in some provincial station. Or sent by mistake to an old address Whose new tenant put it on her dresser With the curlers and the hairspray forgetting To give it to the landlord to forward. And we still wait like children who have sent Two weeks’ allowance far away To answer an enticing advertisement From a crumbling, yellow magazine, Watching through years as long as a childhood summer, Checking the postbox with impatient faith Even on days when mail is never brought.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Most of what happens happens beyond words. The lexicon of lip and fingertip defies translation into common speech. I recognize the musk of your dark hair. It always thrills me, though I can't describe it. My finger on your thigh does not touch skin— it touches your skin warming to my touch. You are a language I have learned by heart. This intimate patois will vanish with us, its only native speakers. Does it matter? Our tribal chants, our dances round the fire performed the sorcery we most required. They bound us in a spell time could not break. Let the young vaunt their ecstasy. We keep our tribe of two in sovereign secrecy. What must be lost was never lost on us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If we could only push these walls apart, unfold the room the way a child might take apart a box and lay it flat upon the floor— so many corners cleared at last! Or else could rip away the roof and stare down at the dirty rooms, the hallways turning on themselves, and understand at last their plan— dark maze without a minotaur, no monsters but ourselves. Yet who could bear to see it all? The slow descending spirals of the dust against the spotted windowpane, the sunlight on the yellow lace, the hoarded wine turned dark and sour, the photographs, the letters—all the crowded closets of the heart. One wants to turn away—and cry for fire to break out on the stairs and raze each suffocating room. But the walls stay, the roof remains strong and immovable, and we can only pray that if these rooms have memories, they are not ours.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Pity the beautiful,the dolls, and the dishes, the babes with big daddies granting their wishes.Pity the pretty boys, the hunks, and Apollos, the golden lads whom success always follows.The hotties, the knock-outs,the tens out of ten, the drop-dead gorgeous, the great leading men.Pity the faded, the bloated, the blowsy, the paunchy Adonis whose luck’s gone lousy.Pity the gods, no longer divine.Pity the night the stars lose their shine.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Echo of the clocktower, footstep in the alleyway, sweep of the wind sifting the leaves. Jeweller of the spiderweb, connoisseur of autumn's opulence, blade of lightning harvesting the sky. Keeper of the small gate, choreographer of entrances and exits, midnight whisper traveling the wires. Seducer, healer, deity or thief, I will see you soon enough— in the shadow of the rainfall, in the brief violet darkening a sunset— but until then I pray watch over him as a mountain guards its covert ore and the harsh falcon its flightless young.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The present that you gave me months agois still unopened by our bed,sealed in its rich blue paper and bright bow.I’ve even left the card unreadand kept the ribbon knotted tight.Why needlessly unfold and bring to lightthe elegant contrivances that hidethe costly secret waiting still inside?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This is my past where no one knows me. These are my friends whom I can’t name— Here in a field where no one chose me, The faces older, the voices the same. Why does this stranger rise to greet me? What is the joke that makes him smile, As he calls the children together to meet me, Bringing them forward in single file? I nod pretending to recognize them, Not knowing exactly what I should say. Why does my presence seem to surprise them? Who is the woman who turns away? Is this my home or an illusion? The bread on the table smells achingly real. Must I at last solve my confusion, Or is confusion all I can feel?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My love, how time makes hardness shine. They come in every color, pure or mixed gray-green of basalt, blood-soaked jasper, quartz, granite and feldspar, even bits of glass, smoothed by the patient jeweller of the tides. Volcano-born, earthquake-quarried, shaven by glaciers, wind-carved, heat-cracked, stratified, speckled, bright in the wet surf— no two alike, all torn from the dry land tossed up in millions on this empty shore. How small death seems among the rocks. It drifts light as a splintered bone the tide uncovers. It glints among the shattered oyster shells, gutted by gulls, bleached by salt and sun— the broken crockery of living things. Cormorants glide across the quiet bay. A falcon watches from the ridge, indifferent to the burdens I have carried here. No point in walking farther, so I sit, hollow as driftwood, dead as any stone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
﻿ISo this is where the children come to die,hidden on the hospital’s highest floor.They wear their bandages like uniformsand pull their iv rigs along the hall with slow and careful steps. Or bald and pale,they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,watching another world on a screen.The mothers spend their nights inside the ward,sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,too small to lie in comfort. Soon they slipbeside their children, as if they might meshthose small bruised bodies back into their flesh.Instinctively they feel that love so strongprotects a child. Each morning proves them wrong.No one chooses to be here. We play the partsthat we are given—horrible as they are.We try to play them well, whatever that means.We need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.The doctors come and go like oracles,their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.There is a word that no one ever speaks. II I put this poem aside twelve years agobecause I could not bear remembering the faces it evoked, and every lineseemed—still seems—so inadequate and grim.What right had I, whose son had walked away, to speak for those who died? And I’ll admitI wanted to forget. I’d lost one childand couldn’t bear to watch another die.Not just the silent boy who shared our room,but even the bird-thin figures dimly glimpsedshuffling deliberately, disjointedlylike ancient soldiers after a parade.Whatever strength the task required I lacked. No well-stitched words could suture shut these wounds. And so I stopped...But there are poems we do not choose to write. III The children visit me, not just in dream,appearing suddenly, silently—insistent, unprovoked, unwelcome.They’ve taken off their milky bandagesto show the raw, red lesions they still bear.Risen they are healed but not made whole.A few I recognize, untouched by years.I cannot name them—their faces pale and graylike ashes fallen from a distant fire.What use am I to them, almost a stranger?I cannot wake them from their satin beds.Why do they seek me? They never speak.And vagrant sorrow cannot bless the dead.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I, with whose colours Myra dress’d her head, I, that ware posies of her own hand-making, I, that mine own name in the chimneys read By Myra finely wrought ere I was waking: Must I look on, in hope time coming may With change bring back my turn again to play? I, that on Sunday at the church-stile found A garland sweet, with true-love knots in flowers, Which I to wear about mine arm was bound, That each of us might know that all was ours: Must I now lead an idle life in wishes, And follow Cupid for his loaves and fishes? I, that did wear the ring her mother left, I, for whose love she gloried to be blamed, I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft, I, who did make her blush when I was named: Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked, Watching with sighs till dead love be awaked? I, that, when drowsy Argus fell asleep, Like jealousy o’erwatched with desire, Was even warned modesty to keep, While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature’s fire: Must I look on a-cold, while others warm them? Do Vulcan’s brothers in such fine nets arm them? Was it for this that I might Myra see Washing the water with her beauties white? Yet would she never write her love to me. Thinks wit of change, while thoughts are in delight? Mad girls must safely love as they may leave; No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The nurse-life wheat within his green husk growing, Flatters our hope, and tickles our desire, Nature’s true riches in sweet beauties showing, Which sets all hearts, with labor’s love, on fire. No less fair is the wheat when golden ear Shows unto hope the joys of near enjoying; Fair and sweet is the bud, more sweet and fair the rose, which proves that time is not destroying. Caelica, your youth, the morning of delight, Enamel’d o’er with beauties white and red, All sense and thoughts did to belief invite, That love and glory there are brought to bed; And your ripe year’s love-noon; he goes no higher, Turns all the spirits of man into desire.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You little stars that live in skies And glory in Apollo’s glory, In whose aspècts conjoinèd lies The heaven’s will and nature’s story, Joy to be likened to those eyes, Which eyes make all eyes glad or sorry; For when you force thoughts from above, These overrule your force by love. And thou, O Love, which in these eyes Hast married Reason with Affection, And made them saints of Beauty’s skies, Where joys are shadows of perfection, Lend me thy wings that I may rise Up, not by worth, but thy election; For I have vowed in strangest fashion To love and never seek compassion.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

O wearisome condition of humanity! Born under one law, to another bound; Vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity; Created sick, commanded to be sound. What meaneth nature by these diverse laws? Passion and reason, self-division cause. Is it the mark or majesty of power To make offenses that it may forgive? Nature herself doth her own self deflower To hate those errors she herself doth give. For how should man think that he may not do, If nature did not fail and punish, too? Tyrant to others, to herself unjust, Only commands things difficult and hard, Forbids us all things which it knows is lust, Makes easy pains, unpossible reward. If nature did not take delight in blood, She would have made more easy ways to good. We that are bound by vows and by promotion, With pomp of holy sacrifice and rites, To teach belief in good and still devotion, To preach of heaven’s wonders and delights; Yet when each of us in his own heart looks He finds the God there, far unlike his books.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Silence augmenteth grief, writing increaseth rage,Staled are my thoughts, which loved and lost the wonder of our age; Yet quickened now with fire, though dead with frost ere now, Enraged I write I know not what; dead, quick, I know not how.Hard-hearted minds relent and rigor's tears abound, And envy strangely rues his end, in whom no fault was found. Knowledge her light hath lost, valor hath slain her knight, Sidney is dead, dead is my friend, dead is the world's delight.Place, pensive, wails his fall whose presence was her pride; Time crieth out, My ebb is come; his life was my spring tide. Fame mourns in that she lost the ground of her reports; Each living wight laments his lack, and all in sundry sorts.He was (woe worth that word!) to each well-thinking mind A spotless friend, a matchless man, whose virtue ever shined; Declaring in his thoughts, his life, and that he writ, Highest conceits, longest foresights, and deepest works of wit.He, only like himself, was second unto none, Whose death (though life) we rue, and wrong, and all in vain do moan;Their loss, not him, wail they that fill the world with cries, Death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.Now sink of sorrow I who live—the more the wrong! Who wishing death, whom death denies, whose thread is all too long; Who tied to wretched life, who looks for no relief, Must spend my ever dying days in never ending grief.Farewell to you, my hopes, my wonted waking dreams, Farewell, sometimes enjoyëd joy, eclipsëd are thy beams. Farewell, self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth, And farewell, friendship's sacred league, uniting minds of worth.And farewell, merry heart, the gift of guiltless minds, And all sports which for life's restore variety assigns; Let all that sweet is, void; in me no mirth may dwell: Philip, the cause of all this woe, my life's content, farewell!Now rhyme, the son of rage, which art no kin to skill,And endless grief, which deads my life, yet knows not how to kill, Go, seek that hapless tomb, which if ye hap to find Salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The bad mother wakes from dreams of imperfection trying to be perfection. All night she’s engineered a train too heavy with supplies to the interior. She fails. The child she loves has taken on bad habits, cigarettes maybe even drugs. She recognizes lies. You don’t fool me, she wants to say, the bad mother, ready to play and win. This lamb who’s gone – this infant she is pinioned to – does not listen, she drives with all her magic down a different route to darkness where all life begins.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 I keep placing my hands over my face, the fingertips just resting on the place where I feel my eyebrows and the fine end of a bone. My eyes are covered with the blood of my hands, my palms hold my jaws. I do this at dinner. My daughter asksAre you all right? and by a common miracle when I smile she knows I am. 2 I ask her what she will do after we eat. Sleep she tells me. But I will clean the deer skull, wash it. 3 You gave me this skull in the woods told me to bring it clean and tell the story I had told you before, about how the deer had come to me, and I said I would. 4 And I put this skull on an old newspaper, pulled the lower part of the jaws free, touched it first carefully, as if it would fall apart in my hands, the bone paper- thin, and then I saw I could scrub, so brushed the surface with steel and my fingers and more and more this surface became familiar to me. 5 I wanted to see the lines of it what it would be if it had been polished by the wind, the water, and my hands, these agents making the skull more itself. Slowly I was not afraid at all and my fingers went into the deepest holes of this thing, not afraid for myself or it, feeling suddenly as if cleaning this small fragment of earth away from the crevices inside was like loving. 6 But it was when I touched the place where the eyes were that I knew this was the shell of the deer that had lived here, this was this deer and not this deer, her home and now empty of her, but not empty of her, I knew also, not empty of her, as my hands trembled. 7 And in that instant remembered you had been in that body of that deer dying, what does it feel like to be a deer dying, the death consumes you like birth, you are nowhere else but in the center. 8 Remembering those gentle deer that watched me as I wept, or the deer that leapt as if out of my mind, when I saw speaking there in that green place the authority of the heart and the deer of the woods where my feet stood, stared at me until I whispered to her and cried at her presence. 9 And when I cleaned the skull I washed myself and sat my body half out of the water and put my hands again over my face, my fingers edging the bone over my eyes, and I thought how good this feels and this is a gesture you make. 10 Tell this story of the deer’s skull you asked quietly and so I came in my own time to put these words carefully here slowly listing each motion on this thin paper as fragile and as tough as knowledge. 1978@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Be like a bear in the forest of yourself. Even sleeping you are powerful in your breath. Every hair has life and standing, as you do, swaying from one foot to the other all the forest stands with you. Each minute sound, one after another, is distinct in your ear. Here in the blur of mixed sensations, you can feel the crisp outline of being, particulate. Great as you are, huge as you are and growling like the deepest drum, the continual vibration that makes music what it is, not some light stone skipped on the surface of things, you travel below sounding the depths where only the dauntless go. Be like the bear and do not forget how you rounded your massive shape over the just ripened berry which burst in your mouth that moment how you rolled in the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling with your sensate skin, how you shut your eyes and swam far and farther still, starlight shaping itself to your body, starship rocking the grand, slow waves under the white trees, in the snowy night.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Happiness. I am not used to this. (There is always something wrong.) Look at it the bright early tree. (I am trying to find out how you fell.) The leaves have already turned. (I want you to see this, how they glow outside the glass.) Morning light strikes differently. For so many years I hardly had time to know such moments. They struck me with such intensity I would have said battered me open. I never understood they were mine. I was panicked.Unhappiness caught up with me all the time. Did you know the speed of light never alters even when you go faster it will be still that much faster than you? (I am thinking that in your fall something momentous occurred.) What I see as beautiful I want you to see too. Next door, the workmen are hammering. Very soon we’ll go to lunch. For some reason this moves me to tears. How life is. (One does not have to explain what occurs. One only need say it has meaning.) Years ago, when I was young I traveled to Italy, took in the great sights. I was in awe, yet I did not understand seeing Masaccio’s frescoes fading like shadows into the walls, this would be the only time nor that I would never forget. Those muted shades are still with me, as possession and longing, and the view too of the square before that church the air, newly spring, that day, all of it. Life, I have finally begun to realize, is real. (All this time you recover from falling will sink indelibly into mind.) The leaves may fall before you are able to see them. Science has recently learned the line of existence is soft and stretches out like a field wind and light shaping the grass energy of sight giving consciousness force. In the meantime we live out our lives. (This morning we talked for so long everything became lucid. How can I say what I see?) At each turning perfection eludes me. One moment is not like another. Last spring the house next door caught fire. There was the smell of gas. We thought both houses would go. I vanished up the hill, went to the house of a friend where we listened for flames and to that aria from Italian opera, was it the one of love, or jealousy, or grief? My house was untouched. Now the one next door is painted, fixed. In place of perfection, the empty hands I turned out to the world are filled. With what? A letter half written, the notes I make on this page, this new feeling about my shoulders of age, that sad child’s story you told me this morning, the workmen’s tools sounding and stopping. What? As time moves through me, does it also move through you? I keep remembering what you said, ways you have of seeing (and that light must have curved with you fall.) This is the paradox of vision: Sharp perception softens our existence in the world. 1986@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 The perfect mother lets the cat sleep on her head. The children laugh. Where is she? She is not carefully ironing the starched ruffles of a Sunday dress. What does she say? She does not speak. Her head is under the cat and like the cat, she sleeps. 2 But her children are in a marsh! Bogged, they have gone wild. Yet, no one should worry. See, they are there, in a sunny kitchen. They drink cups of soup and wipe their faces with yellow napkins. What does it matter if they are hatching plots, if in their waking dreams the poor cat is trapped its hair standing on end? 3 Where shall we go? We ask the perfect mother. What do you want of us? She is no where to be found. Not in the cookie jar we have broken to bits not under the shiny kitchen floor not on our lips. Here we are transfixed, mourning the perfect mother, and she is caught in the trapped cat of her children’s dreams.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The squeak of the wheelbarrow's wheel, Grace note that strikes with every slow Revolution, and then the hushed, rusty Answer in triplets from the invisible Bird in the lackluster maples. Branches, weeds, last autumn's leavings Raked from the moss-eaten pads, beds, Borders, still untrimmed hedges. Also the silent pale blue bells Of my half dozen borage, ringed, Self-seeded from the woods. Daylilies my mother liked to set Roadside in June. Pale Greek anemones She never traveled far enough To find wild, as I did once or twice, but Maybe I'll bring her some, if over there Windflowers blow beside a cloudy sea.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The huge scar-pocked palm leaf outside the papeterie in Papeete. The bikini billboard at the bus station of a busy mining town in Bohemia. That moment’s hesitation in the photo studio: how did I come to appear in this light? The philologist’s pink index card, his commentary on a line from the Iliad. Letters that the lazy postman left behind in a sack labeled “Destination: The Azores.” Now it’s turned out different after all, so different from what we imagined in our evening courses. No idea who it is will one day give the speech to summon up an army of heroes. Fighting machines were the latest hit when our children’s children still went to the movies. What now? How should I pass my days, with the world exposition long since over? Discovered by divers, far from the coast, a yellow pianola at the bottom of the sea.

The city where I grew up was not a western city, nor an eastern city. It lay north of Bohemia, south of Greenland, below sandstone Switzerland in a river valley, green with fields. It was the dump in the middle, the rump of an exquisite gesture in stone — a suite in Hotel “Old Europe.” Stuck under layers of wallpaper, newspapers from a world gone by: reports of Zeppelin flights, League of Nations conferences, “Miscellaneous,” alongside adverts for brassieres and ironing boards. But the view to the river was blocked with gray barracks. And the southern wing, and the northern wing, broken like the Baroque Palace, furnishings given for junk. All of it somehow stranded: the steamers and churches, the domes. And not much life in the bar. But then I found it one day down on the banks, under rusty nails, heaps of nuts and bolts from machines long since dismantled, factories expropriated, torn-down, I found it amongst the bones, unearthed by scavenging dogs, ribs and vertebrae, splinters of human and beast, so it seemed — the key to the city. And found a kind of peace. And knew where I was, and where I came from — until I saw the photographs, not the ones at home in the album, but for sale on the street market stall. Archive pictures, postcards of street scenes, city views from between the wars, moments from a life gone by, some still with the stamp “original print, by hand.” Past the housefronts, all still intact, over the bridges, the broad terraces, along the Königsufer, the banks of the Elbe, people walking, all dead now, but the youngest in their prams. Mothers in dark coats and hats were chained for all time to this or that man with a briefcase. On a traffic island, a boy in lederhosen who would never age, staring from the poster for “Riquet Cocoa Chocolate.” “Alsberg Ladies Wear, Wilsdruffer Straße: the new bathing costume from Alsberg.” And the beauty in silk stockings, getting out of the tram, no. 11, picked out by chance, and her too, fixed in that spot forever. All of them passersby in time — the girl at the flower stall on Altmarkt, the one by the striped awnings on Prager Straße. At the station the clock forever at half past ten. A morning that lasts for eternity — mostly in spring, in summer, in a city that was not eastern, nor western. Scarcely a photo that ever showed it in deep snow. The sign for Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten stood by the entrance to the subway. Soon an r was missing, an n, then an a. Power cuts, petrol grew scarce, people took to bikes again after Stalingrad. Not long now and almost all of it will be erased, a phantasmagoria like the desert palace of Kubla Khan. And your gaze leaped back and forth looking for the place it all began. Was it the high tide? The moment that saw the sparkling twenties in. People peering over the railings at Brühl’s Terrace, dismayed at the rising of the Elbe. Like mourners at a wake all clothed in black. An entire people clothed in black, back then. Though the worst was behind them: four years of war in Europe, carnage. All of them losers, people suddenly with time on their hands, time to gather in dark clumps. Only a girl in a sailor suit, laughing and spitting over the railing into the swollen, mud-brown river, cold as the grave. Or maybe the storm in the thirties, that wrecks the funfair booths at the Vogelwiese fairground. Visitors watch the chaos in despair. Ghost train guests. Roll up and test your strength, the man in the straw hat grumbles, with a rakish eye for the lady in the long white dress. A storm has caught the swingboats, toppled circus tents, whirled the whole magnificent house of cards into ruins like the glass of a kaleidoscope. It was always the anxiety, the thin howl of instability, of fear, that brokered the everyday and steered the course of politics — a force that crept invisibly into every house and hurried every life along. Hopes stirred by the dream of social stability that never came to pass in the squares and streets where election posters in garish red and black promised the moon and the stars.

The sun is beginning to go down over a field of yellow onions. The edges of the clouds are almost pink, and at this hour the maguey rises up like a flower of dark blades. I worked so long today I have forgotten my own hunger. It takes a full minute for me to remember a word I have used all my life. What the Mexicans call poncho. At twilight I see it, abandoned, hanging like a ghost on the limb of a tree: my own brown ruana next to gray speckled chickens pecking at roots and a black track of storm coming west over the green mountain.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This must happen just after I die: At sunrise I bend over my grandparents' empty house in Hazelwood and pull it out of the soft cindered earth by the Mon River. Copper tubing and electric lines hang down like hairs. The house is the size of a matchbox. I sprinkle bits of broken pallets, seeded grass, fingernails, and tamarack needles in the open door of the porch. I scratch a Blue Tip and blow vowels of fire through the living room, the tunneled hallway. Flames run up the wooden stairs. I put my ear beside the hot kitchen window to hear the crackling voices of cupboards and walls. I flip the welder's mask: Sun off the rectangular glass, a rose glint before the white torch.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tonight I light the candles of my eyes in the lee And swing down this branch full of red leaves. Yellow moon, skull and spine of the hare, Arrow me to town on the neck of the air. I hear the undertaker make love in the heather; The candy maker, poor fellow, is under the weather. Skunk, moose, raccoon, they go to the doors in threes With a torch in their hands or pleas: \"O, please . . .\" Baruch Spinoza and the butcher are drunk: One is the tail and one is the trunk Of a beast who dances in circles for beer And doesn't think twice to learn how to steer. Our clock is blind, our clock is dumb. Its hands are broken, its fingers numb. No time for the martyr of our fair town Who wasn't a witch because she could drown. Now the dogs of the cemetery are starting to bark At the vision of her, bobbing up through the dark. When she opens her mouth to gasp for air, A moth flies out and lands in her hair.

Flowering sietecueros trees: How easily we married ourselves to the idea of that bruised light outside the window, capillary fibers of the linen, stained wood of the door frame. Deepening hallway. Beyond the stucco portal, crushed purple. At night, tinnitus we thought, the ringing after an explosion, a frenzied inner ear axle squeal, until I placed my stethoscope's bell on the purpled ceiling: Bats at roost under the terracotta tiles, each squeak a vector between mountains, sicarios ricocheting through the dark. \"If you press your skull between the pillows, it's like a lullaby.\" At dawn our windows imploded from the street. Before the glaziers knocked, a breeze: Blood-sweet draft of begonias rising again from the iron grillwork of our little yard.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Out of the smoke and dust of the little room With tea-talk loud and laughter of happy boys, I passed into the dusk. Suddenly the noise Ceased with a shock, left me alone in the gloom, To wonder at the miracle hanging high Tangled in twigs, the silver crescent clear. Time passed from mind. Time died; and then we were Once more at home together, you and I. The elms with arms of love wrapped us in shade Who watched the ecstatic west with one desire, One soul uprapt; and still another fire Consumed us, and our joy yet greater made: That Bach should sing for us, mix us in one The joy of firelight and the sunken sun.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Watching the dark my spirit rose in flood On that most dearest Prelude of my delight.The low-lying mist lifted its hood, The October stars showed nobly in clear night.When I return, and to real music-making, And play that Prelude, how will it happen then?Shall I feel as I felt, a sentry hardly waking, With a dull sense of No Man's Land again?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
As I went up by Ovillers In mud and water cold to the knee,There went three jeering, fleering spectres, That walked abreast and talked of me. The first said, ‘Here’s a right brave soldier That walks the dark unfearingly;Soon he’ll come back on a fine stretcher, And laughing for a nice Blighty.’ The second, ‘Read his face, old comrade, No kind of lucky chance I see;One day he’ll freeze in mud to the marrow, Then look his last on Picardie.’ Though bitter the word of these first twain Curses the third spat venomously;‘He’ll stay untouched till the war’s last dawning Then live one hour of agony.’ Liars the first two were. Behold me At sloping arms by one – two – three;Waiting the time I shall discover Whether the third spake verity.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
After the dread tales and red yarns of the LineAnything might have come to us; but the divineAfterglow brought us up to a Welsh colonyHiding in sandbag ditches, whispering consolatorySoft foreign things. Then we were taken inTo low huts candle-lit, shaded close by slitten Oilsheets, and there but boys gave us kind welcome,So that we looked out as from the edge of home,Sang us Welsh things, and changed all former notionsTo human hopeful things. And the next day's gunsNor any Line-pangs ever quite could blot outThat strangely beautiful entry to war's rout;Candles they gave us, precious and shared over-rations—Ulysses found little more in his wanderings without doubt.'David of the White Rock', the 'Slumber Song' so soft, and thatBeautiful tune to which roguish words by Welsh pit boysAre sung—but never more beautiful than here under the guns' noise.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
She was a villageOf lovely knowledgeThe high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid —Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomlessHallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body evenHaving got givenA sign undoubtful of a dear England fewDoubt, not many have seen,That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.Home of Twelfth Night — Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;Till I got back I was dumb.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One would remember still Meadows and low hill Laventie was, as to the line and elm row Growing through green strength wounded, as home elms grow. Shimmer of summer there and blue autumn mists Seen from trench-ditch winding in mazy twists. The Australian gunners in close flowery hiding Cunning found out at last, and smashed in the unspeakable lists. And the guns in the smashed wood thumping and grinding. The letters written there, and received there, Books, cakes, cigarettes in a parish of famine, And leaks in rainy times with general all-damning. The crater, and carrying of gas cylinders on two sticks (Pain past comparison and far past right agony gone) Strained hopelessly of heart and frame at first fix. Café-au-lait in dug-outs on Tommies' cookers, Cursed minniewerfs, thirst in eighteen-hour summer. The Australian miners clayed, and the being afraid Before strafes, sultry August dusk time than Death dumber — And the cooler hush after the strafe, and the long night wait — The relief of first dawn, the crawling out to look at it, Wonder divine of Dawn, man hesitating before Heaven's gate. (Though not on Coopers where music fire took at it, Though not as at Framilode beauty where body did shake at it) Yet the dawn with aeroplanes crawling high at Heaven's gate Lovely aerial beetles of wonderful scintillate Strangest interest, and puffs of soft purest white — Soaking light, dispersing colouring for fancy's delight. Of Maconachie, Paxton, Tickler, and Gloucester's Stephens; Fray Bentos, Spiller and Baker, odds and evens Of trench food, but the everlasting clean craving For bread, the pure thing, blessed beyond saving. Canteen disappointments, and the keen boy braving Bullets or such for grouse roused surprisingly through (Halfway) Stand-to. And the shell nearly blunted my razor at shaving; Tilleloy, Pauquissart, Neuve Chapelle, and mud like glue. But Laventie, most of all, I think is to soldiers The Town itself with plane trees, and small-spa air; And vin, rouge-blanc, chocolat, citron, grenadine: One might buy in small delectable cafés there. The broken church, and vegetable fields bare; Neat French market town look so clean, And the clarity, amiability of North French air. Like water flowing beneath the dark plough and high Heaven, Music's delight to please the poet pack-marching there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily; Watching the candle guttering in the draught; Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed With pity and pride, photographs of all colours, All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France; Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours; Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance, Though in a picture only, a common cheap Ill-taken card; and children—frozen, some (Babies) waiting on Dicky-bird to peep Out of the handkerchief that is his home (But he's so shy!). And some with bright looks, calling Delight across the miles of land and sea, That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling Could quite blot out—not mud nor lethargy. Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings. But once—O why did he keep that bitter token Of a dead Love?—that boy, who, suddenly moved, Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken, A girl who better had not been beloved.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If it were not for England, who would bearThis heavy servitude one moment more?To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floorOf filthiest hovels were noble to compareWith this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now thereHarried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'erBy fools made brazen by conceit, and storeOf antique witticisms thin and bare.Only the love of comrades sweetens all,Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.As night-watching men wait for the sunTo hearten them, so wait I on such boysAs neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Little did I dream, England, that you bore me Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows, To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders And your enfolding seas. I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service, Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty, As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit Miraculously shining. Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly, Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets Safe in its bosom. Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ... But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being, And uses consecrate. Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters; None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice; None, but you, repay.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He's gone, and all our plans Are useless indeed. We'll walk no more on Cotswold Where the sheep feed Quietly and take no heed. His body that was so quick Is not as you Knew it, on Severn river Under the blue Driving our small boat through. You would not know him now ... But still he died Nobly, so cover him over With violets of pride Purple from Severn side. Cover him, cover him soon! And with thick-set Masses of memoried flowers— Hide that red wet Thing I must somehow forget.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes; Thy lovely things must all be laid away; And thou, as others, must face the riven day Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums, Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway, Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs Of praise the little versemen joyed to take Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are, For all our skill in words, equal in might And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make The name of poet terrible in just war, And like a crown of honour upon the fight.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I remember plain heroic strengthAnd shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,Then read the blither written by knaves for foolsIn praise of English soldiers lying at length,Who purely dream what England shall be madeGloriously new, free of the old stainsBy us, who pay the price that must be paid,Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.Our silly dreams of peace you put asideAnd brotherhood of man, for you will seeAn armed mistress, braggart of the tide,Her children slaves, under your mastery.We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

You novelize a route with flesh dumped at the ranch, can’t backtrack the courage of miles we traversed in the dark, on a sighing speedboat, through jungles that spat only shoes, calzones, bodies twisted as guitarras when there’s no grito left in them to pluck. Back home, we priested our mornings with sun-dried sombreros, communed with our ghosts & had no wish to sacrifice our bellies, our terneros, our Consuelos. With wings from acero, we’d crash latitudinal objections, mystify Bengay on the mouths of our map-torn feet, pay no heed to grief’s ambidextrous strophes. If we choked on our own blood we harpooned optimism. But when the vans deadlocked our pilgrimage we knew our shadows had crumbed the anesthetic vultures. They pressed their loaded beaks upon our backs until our knees bent sour orange. One asked if we served the enemy, but we took enemy to mean a seed that sits quietly underfoot, abashed to vestibule the grating sun. Blindfolded, we faced the gloom volcanoes of their mothers. How those mothers might’ve screamed like ours in their tortured independence: bloody thunder in the brown-starched symphonies, a wind that howled & shoved its thumbs through feral lands probing for judgment or commiseration. Chingado god that copycatted these legs from monotony. Chingado god that hewed our wrists, a pair of stems to strap behind our wrested boots & jeans. Whoever supplied a plea to that deviant afternoon’s rationed blessings neglected to add chile, sazón, a nosegay of tortillas to the long road. Mothers who’ve come to reclaim our tongues in the dirt: remind us of the braids in the phrasings of our dreams before we vanished. Pat the ground for the bodkinned orchids. Wasn’t it yesterday we were siphoning forecasts with our fingers roving on the table? Or caught your chests pain-leavened & stilled them with the rumpus of our hopes?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Instead of a cup of tea, instead of a milk- silk whelk of a cup, of a cup of nearly six o'clock teatime, cup of a stumbling block, cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk, cup of a cut brown loaf, of a slice, a lack of butter, blueberry jam that's almost black, instead of tannin seeping into the cracks of a pot, the void of an hour seeps out, infects the slit of a cut I haven't the wit to fix with a surgeon's needle threaded with fine-gauge silk as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock. But no key threads the cylinder of a lock. Late afternoon light, transitory, licks the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue, flicks itself out beneath the wheel's revolving spoke. Taut thought's gone, with a blink of attention, slack, a vision of \"death and distance in the mix\" (she lost her words and how did she get them back when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck? The dream-life logic encodes in nervous tics she translated to a syntax which connects intense and unfashionable politics with morning coffee, Hudson sunsets, sex; then the short-circuit of the final stroke, the end toward which all lines looped out, then broke). What a gaze out the window interjects: on the southeast corner, a black Lab balks, tugged as the light clicks green toward a late-day walk by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak. The Bronx-bound local comes rumbling up the tracks out of the tunnel, over west Harlem blocks whose windows gleam on the animal warmth of bricks rouged by the fluvial light of six o'clock.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Lunch: as we close the twentieth century, death, like a hanger-on or a wanna-be sits with us at the cluttered bistro table, inflecting the conversation. Elderly friends take lovers, rent studios, plan trips to unpronounceable provinces. Fifty makes the ironic wager that his biographer will outlive him— as may the erudite eighty-one-year-old dandy with whom a squabble is simmering. His green-eyed architect companion died in the spring. He is frank about his grief, as he savors spiced pumpkin soup, and a sliced rare filet. We’ll see the next decade in or not. This one retains its flavor. “Her new book ...” “... brilliant!” “She slept with ...” “Really!” Long arabesques of silver-tipped sentences drift on the current of our two languages into the mist of late September midafternoon, where the dusk is curling Just thirty-eight: her last chemotherapy treatment’s the same day classes begin again. I went through it a year before she started; but hers was both breasts, and lymph nodes. She’s always been a lax vegetarian. Now she has cut out butter and cheese, and she never drank wine or beer. What else is there to eliminate? Tea and coffee ... ? (Our avocado salads are copious.) It’s easier to talk about politics than to allow the terror that shares both of our bedrooms to find words. It made the introduction; it’s an acquaintance we’ve in common. Trading medical anecdotes helps out when conversation lapses. We don’t discuss Mitterrand and cancer. Four months (I say) I’ll see her, see him again. (I dream my life; I wake to contingencies.) Now I walk home along the river, into the wind, as the clouds break open.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I. The city where I knew you was swift. A lover cabbed to Brooklyn (broke, but so what) after the night shift in a Second Avenue diner. The lover was a Quaker, a poet, an anti-war activist. Was blonde, was twenty-four. Wet snow fell on the access road to the Manhattan Bridge. I was neither lover, slept uptown. But the arteries, streetlights, headlines, phonelines, feminine plural links ran silver through the night city as dawn and the yellow cab passed on the frost-blurred bridge, headed for that day’s last or first coffee. The city where I knew you was rich in bookshops, potlucks, ad hoc debates, demos, parades and picnics. There were walks I liked to take. I was on good terms with two rivers. You turned, burned, flame-wheel of words lighting the page, good neighbor on your homely street in Park Slope, whose Russian zaydes, Jamaican grocers, dyke vegetarians, young gifted everyone, claimed some changes —at least a new food co-op. In the laundromat, ordinary women talked revolution. We knew we wouldn’t live forever but it seemed as if we could. The city where I knew you was yours and mine by birthright: Harlem, the Bronx. Separately we left it and came separately back. There’s no afterlife for dialogue, divergences we never teased apart to weave back together. Death slams down in the midst of all your unfinished conversations. Whom do I address when I address you, larger than life as you always were, not alive now? Words are not you, poems are not you, ashes on the Pacific tide, you least of all. I talk to my- self to keep the line open. The city where I knew you is gone. Pink icing roses spelled out PASSION on a book-shaped chocolate cake. The bookshop’s a sushi bar now, and PASSION is long out of print. We have a Republican mayor. Threats keep citizens in line: anthrax; suicide attacks. A scar festers where towers once were; dissent festers unexpressed. You are dead of a woman’s disease. Who gets to choose what battle takes her down? Down to the ocean, friends mourn you, with no time to mourn. II. You, who stood alone in the tall bay window of a Brooklyn brownstone, conjuring morning with free-flying words, knew the power, terror in words, in flying; knew the high of solitude while the early light prowled Seventh Avenue, lupine, hungry like you, your spoils raisins and almonds, ballpoint pen, yellow foolscap. You, who stood alone in your courage, never hesitant to underline the connections (between rape, exclusion and occupation...) and separations were alone and were not alone when morning blotted the last spark of you out, around you voices you no longer had voice to answer, eyes you were blind to. All your loves were singular: you scorned labels. Claimed black; woman, and for the rest eluded limits, quicksilver (Caribbean), staked out self-definition. Now your death, as if it were “yours”: your house, your dog, your friends, your son, your serial lovers. Death’s not “yours,” what’s yours are a thousand poems alive on paper, in the present tense of a thousand students’ active gaze at printed pages and blank ones which you gave permission to blacken into outrage and passion. You, at once an optimist, a Cassandra, Lilith in the wilderness of her lyric, were a black American, born in Harlem, citizen soldier If you had to die—and I don’t admit it— who dared “What if, each time they kill a black man / we kill a cop?” couldn’t you take down with you a few prime villains in the capitol, who are also mortal? June, you should be living, the states are bleeding. Leaden words like “Homeland” translate abandoned dissident discourse. Twenty years ago, you denounced the war crimes still in progress now, as Jenin, Rammallah dominate, then disappear from the headlines. Palestine: your war. “To each nation, its Jews,” wrote Primo Levi. “Palestinians are Jews to Israelis.” Afterwards, he died in despair, or so we infer, despairing. Top each nation its Jews, its blacks, its Arabs, Palestinians, immigrants, its women. From each nation, its poets: Mahmoud Darwish, Kavanaugh, Shahid (who,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Spring wafts up the smell of bus exhaust, of bread and fried potatoes, tips green on the branches, repeats old news: arrogance, ignorance, war. A cinder-block wall shared by two houses is new rubble. On one side was a kitchen sink and a cupboard, on the other was a bed, a bookshelf, three framed photographs. Glass is shattered across the photographs; two half-circles of hardened pocket bread sit on the cupboard. There provisionally was shelter, a plastic truck under the branches of a fig tree. A knife flashed in the kitchen, merely dicing garlic. Engines of war move inexorably toward certain houses while citizens sit safe in other houses reading the newspaper, whose photographs make sanitized excuses for the war. There are innumerable kinds of bread brought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen: the date, the latitude, tell which one was dropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches. The uncontrolled and multifurcate branches of possibility infiltrate houses’ walls, windowframes, ceilings. Where there was a tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph on a distant computer screen. Elsewhere, a kitchen table’s setting gapes, where children bred to branch into new lives were culled for war. Who wore this starched smocked cotton dress? Who wore this jersey blazoned for the local branch of the district soccer team? Who left this black bread and this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses? Whose father begged for mercy in the kitchen? Whose memory will frame the photograph and use the memory for what it was never meant for by this girl, that old man, who was caught on a ball field, near a window: war, exhorted through the grief a photograph revives. (Or was the team a covert branch of a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen, a bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?) What did the old men pray for in their houses of prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses between blackouts and blasts, when each word was flensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread, both hostage to the happenstance of war? Sometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen. Outside the window, black strokes on a graph of broken glass, birds line up on bare branches. “This letter curves, this one spreads its branches like friends holding hands outside their houses.” Was the lesson stopped by gunfire? Was there panic, silence? Does a torn photograph still gather children in the teacher’s kitchen? Are they there meticulously learning war- time lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
White decorators interested in Art, Black file clerks with theatrical ambitions, kids making pharmaceutical revisions in journals Comp. instructors urged they start, the part-Cherokee teenage genius (maybe), the secretary who hung out with fairies, the copywriter wanting to know, where is my husband? the soprano with the baby, all drank draft beer or lethal sweet Manhattans or improvised concoctions with tequila in summer when, from Third Street, we could feel a night breeze waft in whose fragrances were Latin. The place was run by Polish refugees: squat Margie, gaunt Speedy (whose sobriquet transliterated what?). He’d brought his play from Łódź. After a while, we guessed Margie’s illiteracy was why he cashed checks and she perched near the threshold to ban pros, the underage, the fugitive, and those arrayed impertinently to their sex. The bar was talk and cruising; in the back room, we danced: Martha and the Vandellas, Smokey and the Miracles, while sellers and buyers changed crisp tens for smoke and smack. Some came in after work, some after supper, plumage replenished to meet who knew who. Behind the bar, Margie dished up beef stew. On weeknights, you could always find an upper to speed you to your desk, and drink till four. Loosened by booze, we drifted, on the ripples of Motown, home in new couples, or triples, were back at dusk, with IDs, at the door. Bill was my roommate, Russell drank with me, although they were a dozen years my seniors. I walked off with the eighteen-year-old genius —an Older Woman, barely twenty-three. Link was new as Rimbaud, and better looking, North Beach bar paideon of doomed Jack Spicer, like Russell, our two-meter artificer, a Corvo whose ecclesia was cooking. Bill and Russell were painters. Bill had been a monk in Kyoto. Stoned, we sketched together, till he discovered poppers and black leather and Zen consented to new discipline. We shared my Sixth Street flat with a morose cat, an arch cat, and pot plants we pruned daily. His boyfriend had left him for an Israeli dancer; my husband was on Mykonos. Russell loved Harold, who was Black and bad, and lavished on him dinners “meant for men” like Escoffier and Brillat-Savarin. Staunch blond Dora made rice. When she had tucked in the twins, six flights of tenement stairs they’d descend, elevenish, and stroll down Third Street, desultory night patrol gone mauve and green under the virulent streetlights, to the bar, where Bill and I (if we’d not come to dinner), Link, and Lew, and Betty had already had a few. One sweat-soaked night in pitiless July, wedged on booth benches of cracked Naugahyde, we planned a literary magazine where North Beach met the Lower East Side Scene. We could have titled it When Worlds Collide. Dora was gone, “In case the children wake up.” Link lightly had decamped with someone else (the German engineer? Or was he Bill’s?). Russell’s stooped vale brushed my absent makeup. Armed children spared us home, our good-night hugslaissez-passer. We railed against the war. Soon, some of us bused south with SNCC and CORE. Soon, some of us got busted dealing drugs. The file clerks took exams and forged ahead. The decorators’ kitchens blazed persimmon. The secretary started kissing women, and so did I, and my three friends are dead.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Thought thrusts up, homely as a hyacinth wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable, a ninth-month belly, where the green indelible pattern's inscribed into the labyrinth. Thrust into light, it's air's inhabitant with light and air as food and drink. A hyacinth, tumescent pink on the low wooden Mexican chest confronts the wintry dusk with informed self-interest. Leaf-spears extravagantly ask what idea, still gnarled up in a knot of ganglions, will break through the husk shaped at last, recognizable as thought. • Trace, on a city map, trajectories of partially-forgotten words along the river's arteries, volatile substance of a sentient world. Mauve heather crowds the window-grill. The light lingers a little later, with a slight vernal inflection. In a moon-glazed vase bloom yellow freesias, like some rainy day's brook-bank, in someone else's memory. Small whirlpools of perception widen, ring an infant's numinous discoveries of syllables for animals, toys, trees: a Lab's thick coat, the dusty birds in Claremont Park each tardy urban spring, a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes. • A question-mark in yellow overalls, I could read. I was three. I slept with that pink horse. My one doll's name was V. J. She'd been given to me to celebrate the Victory over Japan, that is to say, the Bomb I'd spend my schooldays taking shelter from. I couldn't tie my shoes. But Reddy the fox, Tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks, spelled me their stories on my mother's lap despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills. My grandparents were dead: not in pogroms, not in the camps—of strokes and heart attacks, merely immigrants, not deportees. \"When you die, does everything just stop?\" • I'm four, in itchy woolen leggings, the day that I can't recognize the man down at the park entrance, waving, as my father. He has ten more years to live, that spring. Dapper and balding he walks toward me; then I run toward him, calling him, flustered by my flawed vision. Underfoot, the maples' green- winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons. His round face, thin nose, moustache silvered gray at thirty-eight look (I think now) Hungarian. I like his wood-smell of two packs a day as he swings me up to his shoulder and I say, things look blurry far away —one Saturday, two years after the war.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We reconstruct lives in the intensive care unit, pieced together in a buffet dinner: two widows with cancerous breasts in their balled hands; a 30-year-old man in a three-month coma from a Buick and a brick wall; a woman who bleeds off and on from her gullet; a prominent socialite, our own nurse, shrieking for twins, “her bump gone”; the gallery of veterans, succored, awake, without valves, some lungs gone. Splicing the meats with fluids seasoned on the dressing room table, she sings “the bump gone” refrain in this 69-degree oven, unstuffing her twin yolks carved from the breast, the dark meat wrapped in tinfoil and clean newspaper; the half black registered nurse hums her six years in an orphanage, her adopted white family, breaded and primed in a posse, rising in clan for their dinner. We reload our brains as the cameras, the film overexposed in the x-ray light, locked with our double door light meters: race and sex spooled and rungs in a hobby; we take our bundle and go home.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Sex fingers toes in the marketplace near your father's church in Hamlet, North Carolina— witness to this love in this calm fallow of these minds, there is no substitute for pain: genitals gone or going, seed burned out, you tuck the roots in the earth, turn back, and move by river through the swamps, singing: a love supreme, a love supreme; what does it all mean? Loss, so great each black woman expects your failure in mute change, the seed gone. You plod up into the electric city— your song now crystal and the blues. You pick up the horn with some will and blow into the freezing night:a love supreme, a love supreme— Dawn comes and you cook up the thick sin 'tween impotence and death, fuel the tenor sax cannibal heart, genitals, and sweat that makes you clean—a love supreme, a love supreme—Why you so black? cause I am why you so funky? cause I am why you so black? cause I am why you so sweet? cause I am why you so black? cause I am a love supreme, a love supreme: So sick you couldn't play Naima, so flat we ached for song you'd concealed with your own blood, your diseased liver gave out its purity, the inflated heart pumps out, the tenor kiss, tenor love:a love supreme, a love supreme— a love supreme, a love supreme—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Whatever city or country road you two are on there are nettles, and the dark invisible elements cling to your skin though you do not cry and you do not scratch your arms at forty-five degree angles as the landing point of a swan in the Ohio, the Detroit River; at the Paradise Theatre you named the cellist with the fanatical fingers of the plumber, the exorcist, and though the gimmicky at wrist and kneecaps could lift the seance table, your voice was real in the gait and laughter of Uncle Henry, who could dance on either leg, wooden or real, to the sound of the troop train, megaphone, catching the fine pitch of a singer on the athletic fields of Virginia. At the Radisson Hotel, we once took a fine angel of the law to the convention center, and put her down as an egret in the subzero platform of a friend— this is Minneapolis, the movies are all of strangers, holding themselves in the delicacy of treading water, while they wait for the trumpet of the 20th Century Limited over the bluff or cranny. You two men like to confront. the craters of history and spillage, our natural infections of you innoculating blankets and fur, ethos of cadaver and sunflower. I hold the dogwood blossom, eat the pear, and watch the nettle swim up in the pools of the completed song of Leadbelly and Little Crow crooning the buffalo and horse to the changes and the bridge of a twelve-string guitar, the melody of “Irene”; this is really goodbye— I can see the precious stones of embolism and consumption on the platinum wires of the mouth: in the flowing rivers, in the public baths of Ohio and Michigan.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In 1915 my grandfather’s neighbors surrounded his house near the dayline he ran on the Hudson in Catskill, NY and thought they’d burn his family out in a movie they’d just seen and be rid of his kind: the death of a lone black family is the Birthof a Nation, or so they thought. His 5’4” waiter gait quenched the white jacket smile he’d brought back from watered polish of my father on the turning seats, and he asked his neighbors up on his thatched porch for the first blossom of fire that would bring him down. They went away, his nation, spittooning their torched necks in the shadows of the riverboat they’d seen, posse decomposing; and I see him on Sutter with white bag from your restaurant, challenged by his first grandson to a foot-race he will win in white clothes. I see him as he buys galoshes for his railed yard near Mineo’s metal shop, where roses jump as the el circles his house toward Brooklyn, where his rain fell; and I see cigar smoke in his eyes, chocolate Madison Square Garden chews he breaks on his set teeth, stitched up after cancer, the great white nation immovable as his weight wilts and he is on a porch that won’t hold my arms, or the legs of the race run forwards, or the film played backwards on his grandson’s eyes.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Soul and race are private dominions, memories and modal songs, a tenor blossoming, which would paint suffering a clear color but is not in this Victorian house without oil in zero degree weather and a forty-mile-an-hour wind; it is all a well-knit family: a love supreme. Oak leaves pile up on walkway and steps, catholic as apples in a special mist of clear white children who love my children. I play “Alabama” on a warped record player skipping the scratches on your faces over the fibrous conical hairs of plastic under the wooden floors. Dreaming on a train from New York to Philly, you hand out six notes which become an anthem to our memories of you: oak, birch, maple, apple, cocoa, rubber. For this reason Martin is dead; for this reason Malcolm is dead; for this reason Coltrane is dead; in the eyes of my first son are the browns of these men and their music.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Above the freeway, over the music, we speak of the strategy of poems, bleeding wives who ulcerate our voices rhythming in the cut-heat Portland stink from the Willamette River; arteries of smog fixate this place in each recording, music, music, on Impulse. This little racist community has few friends; thousands of deerslayers hum into Beaverton, the one talk show driven out for their talk as the liberals dig in to KGO out of San Francisco; we troop toward the Lloyd Center for the ice-skating, the colorette bloomered dream merchants on rented skates, and the Sunday Chronicle near the big hotel. The poets, man and wife, write in the dimming air, their daughter in the toy rooms connecting them, the typewriter tacking the nails and snaps of her gown. This image of separation begins in adoption: her mother adopted out in San Jose; her father disowned, abandoned, torn out of the will; her name: Phoebe. And the sun does shine on them for this visit in squat pigeontoes, and this beach ball sings.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When news came that your mother’d smashed her hip, both feet caught in rungs of the banquet table, our wedding rebroken on the memory of the long lake of silence when the stones of her body broke as an Irish fence of stones, I saw your wet dugs drag with the weight of our daughter in the quick of her sleep to another feeding; then the shoulders dropped their broken antenna branches of fear at the knife running the scars which had been born into the colon for the misspent enema, the clubbed liver unclean with the stones of the gall bladder, and the broken arch of hip lugging you to the lake, the dough inner tube of lading swollen with innerpatching. I pick you up from the floor of your ringing fears, the floor where the photographs you have worked into the cool sky of the gray you love, and you are back at the compost pile where the vegetables burn, or swim in the storm of your childhood, when your father egged you on with his open machinery, the exhaust choking your sisters, and your sisters choked still. Now this voice stops you in accusation, and the years pile up on themselves in the eggs of your stretched sons, one born on his birthday, both dead. I pull you off into the sanctuary of conciliation, of quiet tactics, the uttered question, the referral, which will quiet the condition you have seen in your mother’s shadow, the crutches inching in the uncut grass, and the worn body you will carry as your own birthmark of his scream.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I stood behind his desk chair and when he sat, on rare occasions, on the porch, “sage of Anacostia,” they called him, I smelled his mane glorious, and as a hand saddle the aroma of hair took me to neckline and below. In Egypt, long after Napoleon had shot off the face of the Sphinx, I thought of this man, and the cusp of his palms on my shoulder blades; as always he was carrying the mail of gender, his touch immaculate in the true blend of the cortex, and of the complex, risen on a pulpit, and after the hot air, wintry parlance, the syllables of my name in his ear, when he touched me, as he had touched me then. I had my suspicions of English ladies, actresses, ghosts of the Thames, concubines, as we had been into this next century. And they had their wiles with him. I do not feel forbidden; the cameo ring he gave me, recession of his maleness all I need, and highlights of my dark profile, any children we might have had buried in architecture, and the hate of his daughter Rosetta, who I have spoken to over the grate. The sun rises and sets in our neighborhood: I WILL BURN THESE. But when I place my fingers in that mane it is to the saddle he will come.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He waltzes into the lane ’cross the free-throw line, fakes a drive, pivots, floats from the asphalt turf in an arc of black light, and sinks two into the chains. One on one he fakes down the main, passes into the free lane and hits the chains. A sniff in the fallen air— he stuffs it through the chains riding high: “traveling” someone calls— and he laughs, stepping to a silent beat, gliding as he sinks two into the chains.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The wrinkles on the brown face of the carrying case conform to the buttocks, on which the streaks of water from a five-gallon can dribble on the tailfront of the borrowed shirt he would wear if he could drain the pus from his swaddling bandages, striations of skin tunneling into the photograph. This is no simple mug shot of a runaway boy in a training film, Soweto's pummeled wire, though the turrets of light glisten in smoke, the soft coal hooding his platform entrance, dull and quiet. His father's miner's shoes stand in puddles of polish, the black soot baked into images of brittle torso, an inferno of bullets laid out in a letter bomb, the frontispiece of one sergeant- major blackening his mustache. On the drive to Evaton a blank pass away from Sharpeville where the freehold morgans were bought by a black bishop from Ontario, Canada, on a trek northward from the Cape in 1908, I speak to myself as the woman riding in the backseat talks of this day, her husband's death, twenty-three years ago, run over by an Afrikaner in the wrong passing lane; the passbook on the shoulder of the road leading to Evaton is not the one I have in my hand, and the photograph is not of my great- grandfather, who set sail for Philadelphia in the war year of 1916. He did not want a reception, his letters embarking on a platform at Queenstown where his eloquence struck two Zulu warriors pledged to die in the homelands because they could not spin their own gold. These threaded heads weigh down the ears in design of the warrior, Shaka, indifferent to the ruthless offerings over the dead bodies of his wives, childless in the campaigns with the British, who sit on the ships of the Indian Ocean each kraal shuddering near the borders; her lips turn in profile to the dust rising over a road where his house once stood; one could think of the women carrying firewood as an etching in remembrance to the silence, commencing at Sharpeville, but this is Evaton, where he would come from across the galleyship of spears turning in his robes to a bookmark; it is a good book, the picture of words in the gloss of a photograph, the burned image of the man who wears this image on the tongue of a child, who might hold my hand as we walk in late afternoon into the predestined sun. The press of wrinkles on the blanketed voice of the man who took the train from Johannesburg is flattened in Cape Town, and the history of this book is on a trestle where Gandhi worshipped in Natal, and the Zulu lullaby I cannot sing in Bantu is this song in the body of a passbook and the book passes into a shirt and the back that wears it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

this morning I went to the doctor and talked to him about this move on New Year’s Eve I had trouble connecting my thoughts on Sade and reason we rang in the New Year with Miriam Makeba’s Africa I’d noticed that my inner life had expanded, and that I was having trouble thinking through it. The doctor said that Geodon would loosen my thinking—I noticed that I’d been moving through life for 10 years in a Zyprexa mold. thought control, at its best, like a sonnet. I do not feel invaded by the television that I never see. Brenda made me feel more loved than ever this morning, as my thoughts expanded. Last night, in the slow cooker, I made Lamb and Goat curry—amazingly good. I’d thought to send Joel, and Peter, and Michael an email letting them know of my transition, but did not. The consequences of this transition could be catastrophic. I feel more loving toward Brenda than ever. I could die, or worse. As I meditated today my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense against the wall. Soon, Chuck will be here to play chess upstairs. I told the doctor this morning that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg have not yet been written. My poetry has just begun. I am a Fourth Form, though not as Dodie saw it. Together, we can belong in this world. Artaud arrived at the double as I have. We share more in common than I’d known before last night. I need less sleep than before, and I sleep better and am more rested. I feel sad and cheated that I need to rely on drugs so completely. I wonder about Paul Bowles’ stories. I need to reach out to others through this. The doctor, this morning, said that I was enlightened, but not quite there—somehow—I can’t remember how. I doubt he knows what he means by “enlightenment.” I felt far away from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael talked to me of Christ’s tenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over and over I feel that words do not represent me. I am not sure what that implies of my intentions in using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw the Warhol show of the last ten years of his life. There seemed to have been hope to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves of this beginning, the new life of my mind is settling. It’s been a while since I’ve written. I’ve decided to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added a title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek’s dubious interpretation of Kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home across the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed, I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world. And I am able to speak better. I don’t know what this means about who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life I’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even worse, with up to 6 meds, as I’ve said over and over to friends. I feel the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity, a little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help someone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet this past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy to make Brenda so happy. I don’t know how much longer I will live, and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime soon, but that it’s imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after affirming life as fully as I can. It’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically oppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don’t want to stop at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don’t believe in the West on its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here is love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books will come, more music too. And love is immeasurable when it’s real. I@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

New Year’s morning— everything is in blossom! I feel about average. A huge frog and I staring at each other, neither of us moves. This moth saw brightness in a woman’s chamber— burned to a crisp. Asked how old he was the boy in the new kimono stretched out all five fingers. Blossoms at night, like people moved by music Napped half the day; no one punished me! Fiftieth birthday: From now on, It’s all clear profit, every sky. Don’t worry, spiders, I keep house casually. These sea slugs, they just don’t seem Japanese. Hell: Bright autumn moon; pond snails crying in the saucepan.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I ran, it rained. Late in the afternoon— midsummer, upstate New York, mornings I wrote, read Polish history, and there was a woman whom I thought about; outside the moody, humid American sublime—late in the afternoon, toward sundown, just as the sky was darkening, the light came up and redwings settled in the cattails. They were death's idea of twilight, the whole notes of a requiem the massed clouds croaked above the somber fields. Lady of eyelashes, do you hear me? Whiteness, otter's body, coolness of the morning, rubbed amber and the skin's salt, do you hear me? This is Poland speaking, “era of the dawn of freedom,” nineteen twenty-two. When I ran, it rained. The blackbirds settled their clannish squabbles in the reeds, and light came up. First darkening, then light. And then pure fire. Where does it come from? out of the impure shining that rises from the soaked odor of the grass, the levitating, Congregational, meadow-light-at-twilight light that darkens the heavy-headed blossoms of wild carrot, out of that, out of nothing it boils up, pools on the horizon, fissures up, igniting the undersides of clouds: pink flame, red flame, vermilion, purple, deeper purple, dark. You could wring the sourness of the sumac from the air, the fescue sweetness from the grass, the slightly maniacal cicadas tuning up to tear the fabric of the silence into tatters, so that night, if it wants to, comes as a beggar to the door at which, if you do not offer milk and barley to the maimed figure of the god, your well will foul, your crops will wither in the fields. In the eastern marches children know the story that the aspen quivers because it failed to hide the Virgin and the Child when Herod's hunters were abroad. Think: night is the god dressed as the beggar drinking the sweet milk. Gray beard, thin shanks, the look in the eyes idiot, unbearable, the wizened mouth agape, like an infant's that has cried and sucked and cried and paused to catch its breath. The pink nubbin of the nipple glistens. I'll suckle at that breast, the one in the song of the muttering illumination of the fields before the sun goes down, before the black train crosses the frontier from Prussia into Poland in the age of the dawn of freedom. Fifty freight cars from America, full of medicine and the latest miracle, canned food. The war is over. There are unburied bones in the fields at sun-up, skylarks singing, starved children begging chocolate on the tracks.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Maybe you need to write a poem about grace. When everything broken is broken, and everything dead is dead, and the hero has looked into the mirror with complete contempt, and the heroine has studied her face and its defects remorselessly, and the pain they thought might, as a token of their earnestness, release them from themselves has lost its novelty and not released them, and they have begun to think, kindly and distantly, watching the others go about their days— likes and dislikes, reasons, habits, fears— that self-love is the one weedy stalk of every human blossoming, and understood, therefore, why they had been, all their lives, in such a fury to defend it, and that no one— except some almost inconceivable saint in his pool of poverty and silence—can escape this violent, automatic life’s companion ever, maybe then, ordinary light, faint music under things, a hovering like grace appears. As in the story a friend told once about the time he tried to kill himself. His girl had left him. Bees in the heart, then scorpions, maggots, and then ash. He climbed onto the jumping girder of the bridge, the bay side, a blue, lucid afternoon. And in the salt air he thought about the word “seafood,” that there was something faintly ridiculous about it. No one said “landfood.” He thought it was degrading to the rainbow perch he’d reeled in gleaming from the cliffs, the black rockbass, scales like polished carbon, in beds of kelp along the coast—and he realized that the reason for the word was crabs, or mussels, clams. Otherwise the restaurants could just put “fish” up on their signs, and when he woke—he’d slept for hours, curled up on the girder like a child—the sun was going down and he felt a little better, and afraid. He put on the jacket he’d used for a pillow, climbed over the railing carefully, and drove home to an empty house. There was a pair of her lemon yellow panties hanging on a doorknob. He studied them. Much-washed. A faint russet in the crotch that made him sick with rage and grief. He knew more or less where she was. A flat somewhere on Russian Hill. They’d have just finished making love. She’d have tears in her eyes and touch his jawbone gratefully. “God,” she’d say, “you are so good for me.” Winking lights, a foggy view downhill toward the harbor and the bay. “You’re sad,” he’d say. “Yes.” “Thinking about Nick?” “Yes,” she’d say and cry. “I tried so hard,” sobbing now, “I really tried so hard.” And then he’d hold her for a while— Guatemalan weavings from his fieldwork on the wall— and then they’d fuck again, and she would cry some more, and go to sleep. And he, he would play that scene once only, once and a half, and tell himself that he was going to carry it for a very long time and that there was nothing he could do but carry it. He went out onto the porch, and listened to the forest in the summer dark, madrone bark cracking and curling as the cold came up. It’s not the story though, not the friend leaning toward you, saying “And then I realized—,” which is the part of stories one never quite believes. I had the idea that the world’s so full of pain it must sometimes make a kind of singing. And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps— First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the swordsman fell in Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai in the gray rain, in the Cinemascope and the Tokugawa dynasty, he fell straight as a pine, he fell as Ajax fell in Homer in chanted dactyls and the tree was so huge the woodsman returned for two days to that lucky place before he was done with the sawing and on the third day he brought his uncle. They stacked logs in the resinous air, hacking the small limbs off, tying those bundles separately. The slabs near the root were quartered and still they were awkwardly large; the logs from the midtree they halved: ten bundles and four great piles of fragrant wood, moons and quarter moons and half moons ridged by the saw’s tooth. The woodsman and the old man his uncle are standing in midforest on a floor of pine silt and spring mud. They have stopped working because they are tired and because I have imagined no pack animal or primitive wagon. They are too canny to call in neighbors and come home with a few logs after three days’ work. They are waiting for me to do something or for the overseer of the Great Lord to come and arrest them. How patient they are! The old man smokes a pipe and spits. The young man is thinking he would be rich if he were already rich and had a mule. Ten days of hauling and on the seventh day they’ll probably be caught, go home empty-handed or worse. I don’t know whether they’re Japanese or Mycenaean and there’s nothing I can do. The path from here to that village is not translated. A hero, dying, gives off stillness to the air. A man and a woman walk from the movies to the house in the silence of separate fidelities. There are limits to imagination.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Little green involute fronds of fern at creekside. And the sinewy clear water rushing over creekstone of the palest amber, veined with a darker gold, thinnest lines of gold rivering through the amber like—ah, now we come to it. We were not put on earth, the old man said, he was hacking into the crust of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement, impatient way with an old horn-handled knife, to express ourselves. I knew he had seen whole cities leveled: also that there had been a time of shame for him, outskirts of a ruined town, half Baroque, half Greek Revival, pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks and dogs scavenging among them. His one act of courage then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate, as others did, where a fugitive family of Jews was rumored to be hiding. I never raised my voice, of course, none of us did. He sliced wedges of cheese after the bread, spooned out dollops of sour jam from some Hungarian plum, purple and faintly gingered. Every day the bits of half-mildewed, dry, hard— this is my invention—whitened chocolate, dropped furtively into rubble by the abandoned outbuilding of some suburban mechanic’s shop—but I am sure he said chocolate— and it comforted no one. We talked in whispers.“Someone is taking them.” “Yes,” Janos said, “But it might just be the dogs.” He set the table. Shrugged. Janos was a friend from the university, who fled east to join a people’s liberation army, died in Siberia somewhere. Some of us whispered 'art', he said. Some of us 'truth.' A debate with cut vocal chords. You have to understand that, for all we knew, the Germans would be there forever. And if not the Germans, the Russians. Well, you don't 'have to' understand anything, naturally. No one knew which way to jump. What we had was language, you see. Some said art, some said truth. Truth, of course, was death. Clattered the plates down on the table. No one, no one said 'self-expression.' Well, you had your own forms of indulgence. Didn't people in the forties say 'man' instead of 'the self?' I think I said. I thought 'the self' came in in 1949. He laughed. It's true. Man, we said, is the creature who is able to watch himself eat his own shit from fear. You know what that is? Melodrama. I tell you, there is no bottom to self-pity. This comes back to me on the mountainside. Butterflies— tiny blues with their two-dot wings like quotation marks or an abandoned pencil sketch of a face. They hover lightly over lupine blooms, whirr of insects in the three o'clock sun.What about being? I had asked him. Isn't language responsible to it, all of it, the texture of bread, the hairstyles of the girls you knew in high school, shoelaces, sunsets, the smell of tea? Ah, he said, you've been talking to Milosz. To Czeslaw I say this: silence preceeds us. We are catching up. I think he was quoting Jabes whom he liked to read.Of course, here, gesturing out the window, pines, ragged green of a winter lawn, the bay, you can express what you like, enumerate the vegetation. And you! you have to, I'm afraid, since you don't excel at metaphor. A shrewd, quick glance to see how I have taken this thrust. You write well, clearly. You are an intelligent man. But—finger in the air—silence is waiting. Milosz believes there is a Word at the end that explains. There is silence at the end, and it doesn't explain, it doesn't even ask. He spread chutney on his bread, meticulously, out to the corners. Something angry always in his unexpected fits of thoroughness I liked. The cheese. Then a lunging, wolfish bite.Put it this way, I give you, here, now, a magic key. What does it open? This key I give you, what exactly does it open? Anything, anything! But what? I found that what I thought about was the failure of my marriage, the three or four lost years just at the end and after.For me there is no key, not even the sum total of our acts. But you are a poet. You pretend to make poems. And? She sat on the couch sobbing, her rib cage shaking from its acc@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This morning a cat—bright orange—pawing at the one patch of new grass in the sand-and tanbark-colored leaves. And last night the sapphire of the raccoon's eyes in the beam of the flashlight. He was climbing a tree beside the house, trying to get onto the porch, I think, for a wad of oatmeal Simmered in cider from the bottom of the pan we'd left out for the birds. And earlier a burnished, somewhat dazed woodchuck, his coat gleaming with spring, Loping toward his burrow in the roots of a tree among the drying winter's litter Of old leaves on the floor of the woods, when I went out to get the New York Times. And male cardinals whistling back and forth—sireeep, sreeep, sreeep— Sets of three sweet full notes, weaving into and out of each other like the triplet rhymes in medieval poetry, And the higher, purer notes of the tufted titmice among them, High in the trees where they were catching what they could of the early sun. And a doe and two yearlings, picking their way along the worrying path they'd made through the gully, their coats the color of the forest floor, Stopped just at the roots of the great chestnut where the woodchuck's burrow was, Froze, and the doe looked back over her shoulder at me for a long moment, and leapt forward, Her young following, and bounded with that almost mincing precision in the landing of each hoof Up the gully, over it, and out of sight. So that I remembered Dreaming last night that a deer walked into the house while I was writing at the kitchen table, Came in the glass door from the garden, looked at me with a stilled defiant terror, like a thing with no choices, And, neck bobbing in that fragile-seeming, almost mechanical mix of arrest and liquid motion, came to the table And snatched a slice of apple, and stood, and then quietened, and to my surprise did not leave again. And those little captains, the chickadees, swift to the feeder and swift away. And the squirrels with their smoke-plume tails trailing digging in the leaves to bury or find buried— I'm told they don't remember where they put things, that it's an activity of incessant discovery— Nuts, tree-fall proteins, whatever they forage from around the house of our leavings, And the flameheaded woodpecker at the suet with his black-and-white ladderback elegant fierceness— They take sunflower seeds and stash them in the rough ridges of the tree's bark Where the beaks of the smoke-and-steel blue nuthatches can't quite get at them— Though the nuthatches sometimes seem to get them as they con the trees methodically for spiders' eggs or some other overwintering insect's intricately packaged lump of futurity Got from its body before the cold came on. And the little bat in the kitchen lightwell— When I climbed on a chair to remove the sheet of wimpled plastic and let it loose, It flew straight into my face and I toppled to the floor, chair under me, And it flared down the hall and did what seemed a frantic reconnoiter of the windowed, high-walled living room. And lit on a brass firelog where it looked like a brown and ash grey teenaged suede glove with Mephistophelean dreams, And then, spurt of black sperm, up, out the window, and into the twilight woods. All this life going on about my life, or living a life about all this life going on, Being a creature, whatever my drama of the moment, at the edge of the raccoon's world— He froze in my flashlight beam and looked down, no affect, just looked, The ringtail curled and flared to make him look bigger and not to be messed with— I was thinking he couldn't know how charming his comic-book robber's mask was to me, That his experience of his being and mine of his and his of mine were things entirely apart, Though there were between us, probably, energies of shrewd and respectful tact, based on curiosity and fear— I knew about his talons whatever he knew about me— And as for my experience of myself, it comes and goes, I'm not sure it's any one thing, as my experience of these creatures is not, And I know I am often too far from it or too near, glad to be rid of it which is w@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Recurrences. Coppery light hesitates again in the small-leaved Japanese plum. Summer and sunset, the peace of the writing desk and the habitual peace of writing, these things form an order I only belong to in the idleness of attention.

All the new thinking is about loss. In this it resembles all the old thinking. The idea, for example, that each particular erases the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown- faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk of that black birch is, by his presence, some tragic falling off from a first world of undivided light. Or the other notion that, because there is in this world no one thing to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds, a word is elegy to what it signifies. We talked about it late last night and in the voice of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone almost querulous. After a while I understood that, talking this way, everything dissolves: justice, pine, hair, woman, you and I. There was a woman I made love to and I remembered how, holding her small shoulders in my hands sometimes, I felt a violent wonder at her presence like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat, muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish called pumpkinseed. It hardly had to do with her. Longing, we say, because desire is full of endless distances. I must have been the same to her. But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread, the thing her father said that hurt her, what she dreamed. There are moments when the body is as numinous as words, days that are the good flesh continuing. Such tenderness, those afternoons and evenings, saying blackberry, blackberry, blackberry.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Summoned by conscious recollection, she would be smiling, they might be in a kitchen talking, before or after dinner. But they are in this other room, the window has many small panes, and they are on a couch embracing. He holds her as tightly as he can, she buries herself in his body. Morning, maybe it is evening, light is flowing through the room. Outside, the day is slowly succeeded by night, succeeded by day. The process wobbles wildly and accelerates: weeks, months, years. The light in the room does not change, so it is plain what is happening. They are trying to become one creature, and something will not have it. They are tender with each other, afraid their brief, sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment when they fall away again. So they rub against each other, their mouths dry, then wet, then dry. They feel themselves at the center of a powerful and baffled will. They feel they are an almost animal, washed up on the shore of a world— or huddled against the gate of a garden— to which they can’t admit they can never be admitted.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The man is watching the road, listening,his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance,and because, in the restaurant before the filmthe woman had been describing the end of her marriageand cried, they are not sure whether they are in the theateror on the mountain road, and when the timber truckcomes suddenly around the bend, they both flinch. * * * He found that it was no good trying to tellwhat happened that day.

1 Who will honor the city without a name If so many are dead and others pan gold Or sell arms in faraway countries? What shepherd's horn swathed in the bark of birch Will sound in the Ponary Hills the memory of the absent— Vagabonds, Pathfinders, brethren of a dissolved lodge? This spring, in a desert, beyond a campsite flagpole, —In silence that stretched to the solid rock of yellow and red mountains— I heard in a gray bush the buzzing of wild bees. The current carried an echo and the timber of rafts. A man in a visored cap and a woman in a kerchief Pushed hard with their four hands at a heavy steering oar. In the library, below a tower painted with the signs of the zodiac, Kontrym would take a whiff from his snuffbox and smile For despite Metternich all was not yet lost. And on crooked lanes down the middle of a sandy highway Jewish carts went their way while a black grouse hooted Standing on a cuirassier's helmet, a relict of La Grande Armée.2 In Death Valley I thought about styles of hairdo, About a hand that shifted spotlights at the Student's Ball In the city from which no voice could reach me. Minerals did not sound the last trumpet. There was only the rustle of a loosened grain of lava. In Death Valley salt gleams from a dried-up lake bed. Defend, defend yourself, says the tick-tock of the blood. From the futility of solid rock, no wisdom. In Death Valley no hawk or eagle against the sky. The prediction of a Gypsy woman has come true. In a lane under an arcade, then, I was reading a poem Of someone who had lived next door, entitled \"An Hour of Thought.\" I looked long at the rearview mirror: there, the one man Within three miles, an Indian, was walking a bicycle uphill.3 With flutes, with torches And a drum, boom, boom, Look, the one who died in Istanbul, there, in the first row. He walks arm in arm with his young lady, And over them swallows fly. They carry oars or staffs garlanded with leaves And bunches of flowers from the shores of the Green Lakes, As they came closer and closer, down Castle Street. And then suddenly nothing, only a white puff of cloud Over the Humanities Student Club, Division of Creative Writing.4 Books, we have written a whole library of them. Lands, we have visited a great many of them. Battles, we have lost a number of them. Till we are no more, we and our Maryla.5 Understanding and pity, We value them highly. What else?

Sweet twin breasts, good night. Sleep through to the light, Without spiders.6 The sun goes down above the Zealous Lithuanian Lodge And kindles fire on landscapes \"made from nature\": The Wilia winding among pines; black honey of the Żejmiana; The Mereczanka washes berries near the Żegaryno village. The valets had already brought in Theban candelabra And pulled curtains, one after the other, slowly, While, thinking I entered first, taking off my gloves, I saw that all the eyes were fixed on me.7 When I got rid of grieving And the glory I was seeking, Which I had no business doing, I was carried by dragons Over countries, bays, and mountains, By fate, or by what happens. Oh yes, I wanted to be me. I toasted mirrors weepily And learned my own stupidity. From nails, mucous membrane, Lungs, liver, bowels, and spleen Whose house is made? Mine. So what else is new?

Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year, I felt a door opening in me and I entered the clarity of early morning. One after another my former lives were departing, like ships, together with their sorrow. And the countries, cities, gardens, the bays of seas assigned to my brush came closer, ready now to be described better than they were before. I was not separated from people, grief and pity joined us. We forget—I kept saying—that we are all children of the King. For where we come from there is no division into Yes and No, into is, was, and will be. We were miserable, we used no more than a hundredth part of the gift we received for our long journey. Moments from yesterday and from centuries ago— a sword blow, the painting of eyelashes before a mirror of polished metal, a lethal musket shot, a caravel staving its hull against a reef—they dwell in us, waiting for a fulfillment. I knew, always, that I would be a worker in the vineyard, as are all men and women living at the same time, whether they are aware of it or not.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Late August, given heavy rain and sun For a full week, the blackberries would ripen. At first, just one, a glossy purple clot Among others, red, green, hard as a knot. You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills We trekked and picked until the cans were full, Until the tinkling bottom had been covered With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's. We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre. But when the bath was filled we found a fur, A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache. The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour. I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot. Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

She taught me what her uncle once taught her:How easily the biggest coal block splitIf you got the grain and hammer angled right.The sound of that relaxed alluring blow, Its co-opted and obliterated echo,Taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,Taught me between the hammer and the blockTo face the music. Teach me now to listen,To strike it rich behind the linear black. 1 A cobble thrown a hundred years ago Keeps coming at me, the first stone Aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow. The pony jerks and the riot's on. She's crouched low in the trap Running the gauntlet that first Sunday Down the brae to Mass at a panicked gallop. He whips on through the town to cries of 'Lundy!' Call her 'The Convert'. 'The Exogamous Bride'. Anyhow, it is a genre piece Inherited on my mother's side And mine to dispose with now she's gone. Instead of silver and Victorian lace, The exonerating, exonerated stone. 2 Polished linoleum shone there. Brass taps shone. The china cups were very white and big— An unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug. The kettle whistled. Sandwich and tea scone Were present and correct.

It is Number 5, New Row, Land of the Dead, Where grandfather is rising from his place With spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head To welcome a bewildered homing daughter Before she even knocks. 'What's this? What's this?' And they sit down in the shining room together. 3 When all the others were away at Mass I was all hers as we peeled potatoes. They broke the silence, let fall one by one Like solder weeping off the soldering iron: Cold comforts set between us, things to share Gleaming in a bucket of clean water. And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes From each other's work would bring us to our senses. So while the parish priest at her bedside Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying And some were responding and some crying I remembered her head bent towards my head, Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives— Never closer the whole rest of our lives. 4 Fear of affectation made her affect Inadequacy whenever it came to Pronouncing words 'beyond her'.

I'd naw and aye And decently relapse into the wrong Grammar which kept us allied and at bay. 5 The cool that came off sheets just off the line Made me think the damp must still be in them But when I took my corners of the linen And pulled against her, first straight down the hem And then diagonally, then flapped and shook The fabric like a sail in a cross-wind, They made a dried-out undulating thwack. So we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand For a split second as if nothing had happened For nothing had that had not always happened Beforehand, day by day, just touch and go, Coming close again by holding back In moves where I was x and she was o Inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks. 6 In the first flush of the Easter holidays The ceremonies during Holy Week Were highpoints of our Sons and Lovers phase.

All year the flax-dam festered in the heart Of the townland; green and heavy headed Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods. Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun. Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell. There were dragonflies, spotted butterflies, But best of all was the warm thick slobber Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied Specks to range on window sills at home, On shelves at school, and wait and watch until The fattening dots burst, into nimble Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how The daddy frog was called a bullfrog And how he croaked and how the mammy frog Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too For they were yellow in the sun and brown In rain. Then one hot day when fields were rank With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges To a coarse croaking that I had not heard Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus. Right down the dam gross bellied frogs were cocked On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped: The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting. I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests; snug as a gun. Under my window, a clean rasping sound When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: My father, digging. I look down Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds Bends low, comes up twenty years away Stooping in rhythm through potato drills Where he was digging. The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft Against the inside knee was levered firmly. He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep To scatter new potatoes that we picked, Loving their cool hardness in our hands. By God, the old man could handle a spade. Just like his old man. My grandfather cut more turf in a day Than any other man on Toner’s bog. Once I carried him milk in a bottle Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up To drink it, then fell to right away Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods Over his shoulder, going down and down For the good turf. Digging. The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge Through living roots awaken in my head. But I’ve no spade to follow men like them. Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests. I’ll dig with it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My father worked with a horse-plough, His shoulders globed like a full sail strung Between the shafts and the furrow. The horses strained at his clicking tongue. An expert. He would set the wing And fit the bright steel-pointed sock. The sod rolled over without breaking. At the headrig, with a single pluck Of reins, the sweating team turned round And back into the land. His eye Narrowed and angled at the ground, Mapping the furrow exactly. I stumbled in his hobnailed wake, Fell sometimes on the polished sod; Sometimes he rode me on his back Dipping and rising to his plod. I wanted to grow up and plough, To close one eye, stiffen my arm. All I ever did was follow In his broad shadow round the farm. I was a nuisance, tripping, falling, Yapping always. But today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I Vowels ploughed into other: opened ground. The mildest February for twenty years Is mist bands over furrows, a deep no sound Vulnerable to distant gargling tractors. Our road is steaming, the turned-up acres breathe. Now the good life could be to cross a field And art a paradigm of earth new from the lathe Of ploughs. My lea is deeply tilled. Old ploughsocks gorge the subsoil of each sense And I am quickened with a redolence Of farmland as a dark unblown rose. Wait then...Breasting the mist, in sowers’ aprons, My ghosts come striding into their spring stations. The dream grain whirls like freakish Easter snows. II Sensings, mountings from the hiding places, Words entering almost the sense of touch Ferreting themselves out of their dark hutch— ‘These things are not secrets but mysteries,’ Oisin Kelly told me years ago In Belfast, hankering after stone That connived with the chisel, as if the grain Remembered what the mallet tapped to know. Then I landed in the hedge-school of Glanmore And from the backs of ditches hoped to raise A voice caught back off slug-horn and slow chanter That might continue, hold, dispel, appease: Vowels ploughed into other, opened ground, Each verse returning like the plough turned round. III This evening the cuckoo and the corncrake (So much, too much) consorted at twilight. It was all crepuscular and iambic. Out on the field a baby rabbit Took his bearings, and I knew the deer (I’ve seen them too from the window of the house, Like connoisseurs, inquisitive of air) Were careful under larch and May-green spruce. I had said earlier, ‘I won’t relapse From this strange loneliness I’ve brought us to. Dorothy and William—’ She interrupts: ‘You’re not going to compare us two...?’ Outside a rustling and twig-combing breeze Refreshes and relents. Is cadences. IV I used to lie with an ear to the line For that way, they said, there should come a sound Escaping ahead, an iron tune Of flange and piston pitched along the ground, But I never heard that. Always, instead, Struck couplings and shuntings two miles away Lifted over the woods. The head Of a horse swirled back from a gate, a grey Turnover of haunch and mane, and I’d look Up to the cutting where she’d soon appear. Two fields back, in the house, small ripples shook Silently across our drinking water (As they are shaking now across my heart) And vanished into where they seemed to start. V Soft corrugations in the boortree’s trunk, Its green young shoots, its rods like freckled solder: It was our bower as children, a greenish, dank And snapping memory as I get older. And elderberry I have learned to call it. I love its blooms like saucers brimmed with meal, Its berries a swart caviar of shot, A buoyant spawn, a light bruised out of purple. Elderberry? It is shires dreaming wine. Boortree is bower tree, where I played ‘touching tongues’ And felt another’s texture quick on mine. So, etymologist of roots and graftings, I fall back to my tree-house and would crouch Where small buds shoot and flourish in the hush. VI He lived there in the unsayable lights. He saw the fuchsia in a drizzling noon, The elderflower at dusk like a risen moon And green fields greying on the windswept heights. ‘I will break through,’ he said, ‘what I glazed over With perfect mist and peaceful absences’— Sudden and sure as the man who dared the ice And raced his bike across the Moyola River. A man we never saw. But in that winter Of nineteen forty-seven, when the snow Kept the country bright as a studio, In a cold where things might crystallize or founder, His story quickened us, a wild white goose Heard after dark above the drifted house.

His instep has shrunk cold as a swan's foot or a wet swamp root. His hips are the ridge and purse of a mussel, his spine an eel arrested under a glisten of mud. The head lifts, the chin is a visor raised above the vent of his slashed throat that has tanned and toughened. The cured wound opens inwards to a dark elderberry place. Who will say 'corpse' to his vivid cast? Who will say 'body' to his opaque repose? And his rusted hair, a mat unlikely as a foetus's. I first saw his twisted face in a photograph, a head and shoulder out of the peat, bruised like a forceps baby, but now he lies perfected in my memory, down to the red horn of his nails, hung in the scales with beauty and atrocity: with the Dying Gaul too strictly compassed on his shield, with the actual weight of each hooded victim, slashed and dumped.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I sat all morning in the college sick bay Counting bells knelling classes to a close. At two o'clock our neighbours drove me home. In the porch I met my father crying— He had always taken funerals in his stride— And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow. The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram When I came in, and I was embarrassed By old men standing up to shake my hand And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble'. Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest, Away at school, as my mother held my hand In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs. At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses. Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him For the first time in six weeks. Paler now, Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple, He lay in the four-foot box as in his cot. No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear. A four-foot box, a foot for every year.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I returned to a long strand, the hammered curve of a bay, and found only the secular powers of the Atlantic thundering. I faced the unmagical invitations of Iceland, the pathetic colonies of Greenland, and suddenly those fabulous raiders, those lying in Orkney and Dublin measured against their long swords rusting, those in the solid belly of stone ships, those hacked and glinting in the gravel of thawed streams were ocean-deafened voices warning me, lifted again in violence and epiphany. The longship’s swimming tongue was buoyant with hindsight— it said Thor’s hammer swung to geography and trade, thick-witted couplings and revenges, the hatreds and behind-backs of the althing, lies and women, exhaustions nominated peace, memory incubating the spilled blood. It said, ‘Lie down in the word-hoard, burrow the coil and gleam of your furrowed brain. Compose in darkness. Expect aurora borealis in the long foray but no cascade of light. Keep your eye clear as the bleb of the icicle, trust the feel of what nubbed treasure your hands have known.’@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. The Ministry of Fear for Seamus Deane Well, as Kavanagh said, we have lived In important places. The lonely scarp Of St Columb’s College, where I billeted For six years, overlooked your Bogside. I gazed into new worlds: the inflamed throat Of Brandywell, its floodlit dogtrack, The throttle of the hare. In the first week I was so homesick I couldn’t even eat The biscuits left to sweeten my exile. I threw them over the fence one night In September 1951 When the lights of houses in the Lecky Road Were amber in the fog. It was an act Of stealth. Then Belfast, and then Berkeley. Here’s two on’s are sophisticated, Dabbling in verses till they have become A life: from bulky envelopes arriving In vacation time to slim volumes Despatched `with the author’s compliments’. Those poems in longhand, ripped from the wire spine Of your exercise book, bewildered me— Vowels and ideas bandied free As the seed-pods blowing off our sycamores. I tried to write about the sycamores And innovated a South Derry rhyme With hushed and lulled full chimes for pushed and pulled. Those hobnailed boots from beyond the mountain Were walking, by God, all over the fine Lawns of elocution. Have our accents Changed? ‘Catholics, in general, don’t speak As well as students from the Protestant schools.’ Remember that stuff? Inferiority Complexes, stuff that dreams were made on. ‘What’s your name, Heaney?’ ‘Heaney, Father.’ ‘Fair Enough.’ On my first day, the leather strap Went epileptic in the Big Study, Its echoes plashing over our bowed heads, But I still wrote home that a boarder’s life Was not so bad, shying as usual. On long vacations, then, I came to life In the kissing seat of an Austin 16 Parked at a gable, the engine running, My fingers tight as ivy on her shoulders, A light left burning for her in the kitchen. And heading back for home, the summer’s Freedom dwindling night by night, the air All moonlight and a scent of hay, policemen Swung their crimson flashlamps, crowding round The car like black cattle, snuffing and pointing The muzzle of a Sten gun in my eye: ‘What’s your name, driver?’ ‘Seamus ...’ Seamus? They once read my letters at a roadblock And shone their torches on your hieroglyphics, ‘Svelte dictions’ in a very florid hand. Ulster was British, but with no rights on The English lyric: all around us, though We hadn’t named it, the ministry of fear.2. A Constable Calls His bicycle stood at the window-sill, The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher Skirting the front mudguard, Its fat black handlegrips Heating in sunlight, the ‘spud’ Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back, The pedal treads hanging relieved Of the boot of the law. His cap was upside down On the floor, next his chair. The line of its pressure ran like a bevel In his slightly sweating hair. He had unstrapped The heavy ledger, and my father Was making tillage returns In acres, roods, and perches. Arithmetic and fear. I sat staring at the polished holster With its buttoned flap, the braid cord Looped into the revolver butt. ‘Any other root crops? Mangolds? Marrowstems? Anything like that?’ ‘No.’ But was there not a line Of turnips where the seed ran out In the potato field? I assumed Small guilts and sat Imagining the black hole in the barracks. He stood up, shifted the baton-case Farther round on his belt, Closed the domesday book, Fitted his cap back with two hands, And looked at me as he said goodbye. A shadow bobbed in the window. He was snapping the carrier spring Over the ledger. His boot pushed off And the bicycle ticked, ticked, ticked.3. Orange Drums, Tyrone, 1966 The lambeg balloons at his belly, weighs Him back on his haunches, lodging thunder Grossly there between his chin and his knees. He is raised up by what he buckles under. Each arm extended by a seasoned rod, He parades behind it. And though the drummers Are granted passage through the nodding crowd, It is the drums preside, like giant tumours. To every cocked ear, expert in its greed, His battered signature subscribes ‘No Pope’. The goatskin’s s@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough. Cunning life keeps asking for more and then a drop more. Our ankles are weighted with lead, we delve under the wave. We bend to our spades, we survive the force of the gusher. Our bodies fountain with sweat in the deeps of the sea, Our forehead aches and holds like a sunken prow. We are out of breath, divining the heart of the geyser, Constellations are bobbing like corks above on the swell. Earth is a waterwheel, the buckets go up and go down, But to keep the whole aqueous architecture standing its ground We must make a ring with our bodies and dance out a round On the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water. Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough. Come rain, come thunder, come deluged dams washed away, Our thirst is unquenchable. A cloud in the water’s a siren. We become two shades, deliquescent, drowning in song. My love, under the tall sky of hope Our love and our love alone Keeps dowsing for water. Sinking the well of each other, digging together. Each one the other’s phantom limb in the sea.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Pangur Bán and I at work, Adepts, equals, cat and clerk: His whole instinct is to hunt, Mine to free the meaning pent. More than loud acclaim, I love Books, silence, thought, my alcove. Happy for me, Pangur Bán Child-plays round some mouse’s den. Truth to tell, just being here, Housed alone, housed together, Adds up to its own reward: Concentration, stealthy art. Next thing an unwary mouse Bares his flank: Pangur pounces. Next thing lines that held and held Meaning back begin to yield. All the while, his round bright eye Fixes on the wall, while I Focus my less piercing gaze On the challenge of the page. With his unsheathed, perfect nails Pangur springs, exults and kills. When the longed-for, difficult Answers come, I too exult. So it goes. To each his own. No vying. No vexation. Taking pleasure, taking pains, Kindred spirits, veterans. Day and night, soft purr, soft pad, Pangur Bán has learned his trade. Day and night, my own hard work Solves the cruxes, makes a mark.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

“Burnished,” when applied to limbs, refers you to furniture, or wood at least, a hint the skin has been burned beyond the human, & then beyond. Necessary for the removal of skin from a burnished limb is an implement sharper rather than duller, wieldy & willing to dig without displacement. The scrape of flint on a burnished limb —if you say “arm” you must mean it— resembles, no doubt, a chisel (of iron?) that furls what’s before it, away. The point of whatever has been lost between the stasis of the burnished limb & its movement away from the rest of what you have identified as skin, the skin of a burnished limb, is to bring to bear the thought of bone & how it relates or, better, responds to its covering uncurling from it flake by flake & amassing, forceless, on the floor, the floor you will describe as cement or concrete, at least rug- and wood-less, the wood being the skin of the burnished limb, until the skin is just another piece of your household furniture.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There are rooms that know you, rooms you know & can name, rooms that rise & stutter into view if you stare long enough. Rooms where nothing happened but in your head, where the world went on apart from you, you trying to rise to it. Rooms with walls of white blocks, one window, the only sound the bang bang banging of the headboard against the wall, your bed still. The room where the bed fell on you, the room where the hand going down was not your own, the groping tongue the proof. The room you talked your way out of, four men of monosyllables, thick arms & necks flushed pink, closing in, emptying the air between. The room where you were walked in on, the room where you were the walker, both times the last time in that room. The room with no door, a woman across the threshold, you crawling to her, over her to the bathroom to press your cheek against the white, your name an indictment among the stalls. The room the sun never touched, the sound of cars dropping you to sleep, your pupils large & hungry for light.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Ay me, to whom shall I my case complain, That may compassion my impatient grief? Or where shall I unfold my inward pain, That my enriven heart may find relief? Shall I unto the heavenly pow’rs it show, Or unto earthly men that dwell below? To heavens? Ah, they, alas, the authors were, And workers of my unremedied woe: For they foresee what to us happens here, And they foresaw, yet suffered this be so. From them comes good, from them comes also ill, That which they made, who can them warn to spill. To men? Ah, they, alas, like wretched be, And subject to the heavens’ ordinance: Bound to abide whatever they decree. Their best redress is their best sufferance. How then can they, like wretched, comfort me, The which no less need comforted to be? Then to myself will I my sorrow mourn, Sith none alive like sorrowful remains: And to myself my plaints shall back return, To pay their usury with doubled pains. The woods, the hills, the rivers shall resound The mournful accent of my sorrow’s ground. Woods, hills, and rivers now are desolate, Sith he is gone the which them all did grace: And all the fields do wail their widow state, Sith death their fairest flow’r did late deface. The fairest flow’r in field that ever grew, Was Astrophel; that was, we all may rue. What cruel hand of cursed foe unknown, Hath cropped the stalk which bore so fair a flow’r? Untimely cropped, before it well were grown, And clean defaced in untimely hour. Great loss to all that ever him did see, Great loss to all, but greatest loss to me. Break now your garlands, O ye shepherds’ lasses, Sith the fair flow’r, which them adorned, is gone: The flow’r, which them adorned, is gone to ashes, Never again let lass put garland on. Instead of garland, wear sad cypress now, And bitter elder, broken from the bough. Ne ever sing the love-lays which he made: Who ever made such lays of love as he? Ne ever read the riddles, which he said Unto yourselves, to make you merry glee. Your merry glee is now laid all abed, Your merry maker now, alas, is dead. Death, the devourer of all the world’s delight, Hath robbed you and reft from me my joy: Both you and me and all the world he quite Hath robbed of joyance, and left sad annoy. Joy of the world, and shepherds’ pride was he, Shepherds’ hope never like again to see. O Death, that hast us of such riches reft, Tell us at least, what hast thou with it done? What is become of him whose flow’r here left Is but the shadow of his likeness gone: Scarce like the shadow of that which he was, Naught like, but that he like a shade did pass. But that immortal spirit, which was decked With all the dowries of celestial grace: By sovereign choice from th’heavenly choirs select, And lineally derived from angels’ race, Oh, what is now of it become, aread. Ay me, can so divine a thing be dead? Ah no: it is not dead, ne can it die, But lives for aye, in blissful Paradise: Where like a new-born babe it soft doth lie, In bed of lilies wrapped in tender wise, And compassed all about with roses sweet, And dainty violets from head to feet. There thousand birds all of celestial brood, To him do sweetly carol day and night: And with strange notes, of him well understood, Lull him asleep in angel-like delight; Whilst in sweet dream to him presented be Immortal beauties, which no eye may see. But he them sees and takes exceeding pleasure Of their divine aspects, appearing plain, And kindling love in him above all measure, Sweet love still joyous, never feeling pain. For what so goodly form he there doth see, He may enjoy from jealous rancor free. There liveth he in everlasting bliss, Sweet spirit never fearing more to die: Ne dreading harm from any foes of his, Ne fearing savage beasts’ more cruelty. Whilst we here, wretches, wail his private lack, And with vain vows do often call him back. But live thou there still happy, happy spirit, And give us leave thee here thus to lament: Not thee that dost thy heaven’s joy inherit, But our own selves that here in dole are drent. Thus do we weep and wail, and wear our eyes, Mourni@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Oh, what a lantern, what a lamp of light Is thy pure word to me To clear my paths and guide my goings right! I swore and swear again, I of the statues will observer be, Thou justly dost ordain. The heavy weights of grief oppress me sore: Lord, raise me by the word, As thou to me didst promise heretofore. And this unforced praise I for an off’ring bring, accept, O Lord, And show to me thy ways. What if my life lie naked in my hand, To every chance exposed! Should I forget what thou dost me command? No, no, I will not stray From thy edicts though round about enclosed With snares the wicked lay. Thy testimonies as mine heritage, I have retained still: And unto them my heart’s delight engage, My heart which still doth bend, And only bend to do what thou dost will, And do it to the end.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
O Lord, my praying hear; Lord, let my cry come to thine ear. Hide not thy face away, But haste, and answer me, In this my most, most miserable day, Wherein I pray and cry to thee. My days as smoke are past; My bones as flaming fuel waste, Mown down in me, alas. With scythe of sharpest pain. My heart is withered like the wounded grass; My stomach doth all food disdain. So lean my woes me leave, That to my flesh my bones do cleave; And so I bray and howl, As use to howl and bray The lonely pelican and desert owl, Like whom I languish long the day. I languish so the day, The night in watch I waste away; Right as the sparrow sits, Bereft of spouse, or son, Which irked alone with dolor’s deadly fits To company will not be won. As day to day succeeds, So shame on shame to me proceeds From them that do me hate, Who of my wrack so boast, That wishing ill, they wish but my estate, Yet think they wish of ills the most. Therefore my bread is clay; Therefore my tears my wine allay. For how else should it be, Sith thou still angry art, And seem’st for naught to have advanced me, But me advanced to subvert? The sun of my life-days Inclines to west with falling rays, And I as hay am dried, While yet in steadfast seat Eternal thou eternally dost bide, Thy memory no years can fret. Oh, then at length arise; On Zion cast thy mercy’s eyes. Now is the time that thou To mercy shouldst incline Concerning her: O Lord, the time is now Thyself for mercy didst assign. Thy servants wait the day When she, who like a carcass lay Stretched forth in ruin’s bier, Shall so arise and live, The nations all Jehova’s name shall fear, All kings to thee shall glory give. Because thou hast anew Made Zion stand, restored to view Thy glorious presence there, Because thou hast, I say, Beheld our woes and not refused to hear What wretched we did plaining pray, This of record shall bide To this and every age beside. And they commend thee shall Whom thou anew shall make, That from the prospect of thy heav’nly hall Thy eye of earth survey did take, Heark’ning to prisoners’ groans, And setting free condemned ones, That they, when nations come, And realms to serve the Lord, In Zion and in Salem might become Fit means his honor to record. But what is this if I In the mid way should fall and die? My God, to thee I pray, Who canst my prayer give. Turn not to night the noontide of my day, Since endless thou dost ageless live. The earth, the heaven stands Once founded, formed by thy hands: They perish, thou shalt bide; They old, as clothes shall wear, Till changing still, full change shall them betide, Unclothed of all the clothes they bear. But thou art one, still one: Time interest in thee hath none. Then hope, who godly be, Or come of godly race: Endless your bliss, as never ending he, His presence your unchanged place.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Oh, laud the Lord, the God of hosts commend, Exalt his pow’r, advance his holiness: With all your might lift his almightiness; Your greatest praise upon his greatness spend. Make trumpet’s noise in shrillest notes ascend; Make lute and lyre his loved fame express; Him let the pipe, him let the tabret bless, Him organ’s breath, that winds or waters lend. Let ringing timbrels so his honor sound, Let sounding cymbals so his glory ring, That in their tunes such melody be found As fits the pomp of most triumphant king. Conclude: by all that air or life enfold, Let high Jehovah highly be extolled.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
O Lord, whose grace no limits comprehend; Sweet Lord, whose mercies stand from measure free; To me that grace, to me that mercy send, And wipe, O Lord, my sins from sinful me. Oh, cleanse, oh, wash, my foul iniquity; Cleanse still my spots, still wash away my stainings, Till stains and spots in me leave no remainings. For I, alas, acknowledging do know My filthy fault, my faulty filthiness To my soul’s eye incessantly doth show, Which done to thee, to thee I do confess, Just judge, true witness, that for righteousness Thy doom may pass against my guilt awarded, Thy evidence for truth may be regarded. My mother, lo, when I began to be, Conceiving me, with me did sin conceive: And as with living heat she cherished me, Corruption did like cherishing receive. But, lo, thy love to purest good doth cleave, And inward truth: which, hardly else discerned, My truant soul in thy hid school hath learned. Then as thyself to lepers hast assigned, With hyssop, Lord, thy hyssop, purge me so: And that shall cleanse the lepry of my mind. Make over me thy mercy’s streams to flow, So shall my whiteness scorn the whitest snow. To ear and heart send sounds and thoughts of gladness, That bruised bones may dance away their sadness. Thy ill-pleased eye from my misdeeds avert: Cancel the registers my sins contain: Create in me a pure, clean, spotless heart; Inspire a sprite where love of right may reign Ah, cast me not from thee; take not again Thy breathing grace; again thy comfort send me, And let the guard of thy free sprite attend me. So I to them a guiding hand will be, Whose faulty feet have wandered from thy way, And turned from sin will make return to thee, Whom turned from thee sin erst had led astray. O God, God of my health, oh, do away My bloody crime: so shall my tongue be raised To praise thy truth, enough cannot be praised. Unlock my lips, shut up with sinful shame: Then shall my mouth, O Lord, thy honor sing. For bleeding fuel for thy altar’s flame, To gain thy grace what boots it me to bring? Burt-off’rings are to thee no pleasant thing. The sacrifice that God will hold respected, Is the heart-broken soul, the sprite dejected.Lastly, O Lord, how so I stand or fall, Leave not thy loved Zion to embrace; But with thy favor build up Salem’s wall, And still in peace, maintain that peaceful place. Then shalt thou turn a well-accepting face To sacred fires with offered gifts perfumed: Till ev’n whole calves on altars be consumed.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My God, most glad to look, most prone to hear, An open ear, oh, let my prayer find, And from my plaint turn not thy face away. Behold my gestures, hearken what I say, While uttering moans with most tormented mind, My body I no less torment and tear. For, lo, their fearful threat’nings would mine ear, Who griefs on griefs on me still heaping lay, A mark to wrath and hate and wrong assigned; Therefore, my heart hath all his force resigned To trembling pants; death terrors on me pray; I fear, nay, shake, nay, quiv’ring quake with fear. Then say I, oh, might I but cut the wind, Borne on the wing the fearful dove doth bear: Stay would I not, till I in rest might stay. Far hence, oh, far, then would I take my way Unto the desert, and repose me there, These storms of woe, these tempests left behind. But swallow them, O Lord, in darkness blind, Confound their counsels, lead their tongues astray, That what they mean by words may not appear. For mother Wrong within their town each where, And daughter Strife their ensigns so display, As if they only thither were confined. These walk their city walls both night and day; Oppressions, tumults, guiles of every kind Are burgesses and dwell the middle near; About their streets his masking robes doth wear Mischief clothed in deceit, with treason lined, Where only he, he only bears the sway. But not my foe with me this prank did play, For then I would have borne with patient cheer An unkind part from whom I know unkind, Nor he whose forehead Envy’s mark had signed, His trophies on my ruins sought to rear, From whom to fly I might have made assay. But this to thee, to thee impute I may, My fellow, my companion, held most dear, My soul, my other self, my inward friend: Whom unto me, me unto whom did bind Exchanged secrets, who together were God’s temple wont to visit, there to pray. Oh, let a sudden death work their decay, Who speaking fair such cankered malice mind, Let them be buried breathing in their bier; But purple morn, black ev’n, and midday clear Shall see my praying voice to God inclined, Rousing him up, and naught shall me dismay. He ransomed me; he for my safety fined In fight where many sought my soul to slay; He, still himself to no succeeding heir Leaving his empire shall no more forbear But at my motion, all these atheists pay, By whom, still one, such mischiefs are designed. Who but such caitiffs would have undermined, Nay, overthrown, from whom but kindness mere They never found? Who would such trust betray? What buttered words! Yet war their hearts bewray. Their speech more sharp than sharpest sword or spear Yet softer flows than balm from wounded rind. But my o’erloaden soul, thyself upcheer, Cast on God’s shoulders what thee down doth weigh Long borne by thee with bearing pained and pined: To care for thee he shall be ever kind; By him the just in safety held away Changeless shall enter, live, and leave the year: But, Lord, how long shall these men tarry here? Fling them in pit of death where never shined The light of life, and while I make my stay On thee, let who their thirst with blood allay Have their life-holding thread so weakly twined That it, half-spun, death may in sunder shear.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Thy mercy, Lord, Lord, now thy mercy show: On thee I lie; To thee I fly. Hide me, hive me, as thine own, Till these blasts be overblown, Which now do fiercely blow. To highest God I will erect my cry, Who quickly shall Dispatch this all. He shall down from heaven send From disgrace me to defend His love and verity. My soul encaged lies with lions’ brood, Villains whose hands Are fiery brands, Teeth more sharp than shaft or spear, Tongues far better edge do bear Than swords to shed my blood. As high as highest heav’n can give thee place, O Lord, ascend, And thence extend With most bright, most glorious show Over all the earth below, The sunbeams of thy face. Me to entangle every way I go Their trap and net Is ready set. Holes they dig but their own holes Pitfalls make for their own souls: So, Lord, oh, serve them so. My heart prepared, prepared is my heart To spread thy praise With tuned lays: Wake my tongue, my lute awake, Thou my harp the consort make, Myself will bear a part. Myself when first the morning shall appear, With voice and string So will thee sing: That this earthly globe, and all Treading on this earthly ball, My praising notes shall hear. For god, my only God, thy gracious love Is mounted far Above each star, Thy unchanged verity Heav’nly wings do lift as high As clouds have room to move. As high as highest heav’n can give thee place, O Lord, ascend And thence extend With most bright, most glorious show Over all the earth below, The sunbeams of thy face.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
How lovely is thy dwelling, Great god, to whom all greatness is belonging! To view thy courts far, far from any telling My soul doth long and pine with longing Unto the God that liveth, The God that all life giveth, My heart and body both aspire, Above delight, beyond desire. Alas, the sparrow knoweth The house where free and fearless she resideth; Directly to the nest the swallow goeth, Where with her sons she safe abideth. Oh, altars thine, most mighty In war, yea, most almighty: Thy altars, Lord, ah, why should I From altars thine excluded lie? Oh, happy who remaineth Thy household-man and still thy praise unfoldeth! Oh, happy who himself on thee sustaineth, Who to thy house his journey holdeth! Me seems I see them going Where mulberries are growing: How wells they dig in thirsty plain, And cisterns make for falling rain. Me seems I see augmented Still troop with troop, till all at length discover Zion, where to their sight is represented The Lord of hosts, the Zion lover. O Lord, O God, most mighty In war, yea, most almighty: Hear what I beg; hearken, I say, O Jacob’s God, to what I pray. Thou art the shield us shieldeth: Then, Lord, behold the face of thine anointed One day spent in thy courts more comfort yieldeth Than thousands otherwise appointed. I count it clearer pleasure To spend my age’s treasure Waiting a porter at thy gates Than dwell a lord with wicked mates. Thou art the sun that shineth; Thou art the buckler, Lord that us defendeth: Glory and grace Jehovah’s hand assigneth And good without refusal sendeth To him who truly treadeth The path to pureness leadeth. O Lord of might, thrice blessed he Whose confidence is built on thee.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My Muse with thine, itself dared to combine As mortal stuff with that which is divine: Let thy fair beams give luster to the restThat Israel’s King may deign his own, transformed In substance no, but superficial ’tire; And English guised in some sort may aspire To better grace thee what the vulgar formed: His sacred tones, age after age admire; Nations grow great in pride and pure desire So to excel in holy rites performed. Oh, had that soul which honor brought to rest Too soon not left and reft the world of all What man could show, which we perfection call, This precious piece had sorted with the best. But ah, wide festered wounds that never shall Nor must be closed, unto fresh bleeding fall: Ah, memory, what needs this new arrest? Yet blessed grief, that sweetness can impart Since thou art blest! Wrongly do I complain: Whatever weights my heavy thoughts sustain Dear feels my soul for thee. I know my part Nor be my weakness to thy rites a stain, Rites to aright, life-blood would not refrain: Assist me, then, that life what thine did part. Time may bring forth what time hath yet suppressed In whom thy loss hath laid to utter waste; The wrack of time, untimely all defaced, Remaining as the tomb of life deceased, Where, in my heart the highest room thou hast; There, truly there, thy earthly being is placed, Triumph of death: in life how more than blest. Behold, oh, that thou were now to behold This finished long perfection’s part begun, The rest but pieced, as left by thee undone. Pardon blest soul, presumption overbold, If love and zeal hath to this error run: ’Tis zealous love, love that hath never done, Nor can enough, though justly here controlled. But since it hath no other scope to go, Nor other purpose but to honor thee, That thine may shine, where all the Graces be; And that my thoughts (like smallest streams that flow, Pay to their sea, their tributary fee) Do strive, yet have no means to quit nor free That mighty debt of infinities I owe To thy great worth which time to times enroll, Wonder of men, sole born, sole of thy kind Complete in all, but heavenly was thy mind, For wisdom, goodness, sweetness, fairest soul: Too good to wish, too fair for earth, refined For heaven, where all true glory rests confined; And where but there no life without control? Oh, when from this account, this cast-up sum, This reck’ning made the audit of my woe, Sometime of rase my swelling passions know How work my thoughts, my sense is stricken dumb That would thee more than words could ever show, Which all fall short. Who knew thee best do know There lives no wit that may thy praise become. And rest fair monuments of thy fair fame, Though not complete. Nor can we reach, in thought, What on that goodly piece time would have wrought Had divers so spared that life (but life) to frame The rest. Alas, such loss! The world hath naught Can equal it, nor, oh, more grievance brought, Yet what remains must ever crown thy name. Receive these hymns, these obsequies receive, (If any mark of thy secret spirit thou bear) Made only thine, and no name else must wear. I can no more: Dear Soul, I take my leave; My sorrow strives to mount the highest sphere.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I enter the void, it has the shape of a viola: Israel, Jenin, West Bank, Nablus—a rubble boy shifts his scapula as if it was his continent, underground Gazaground, I want to say—his only bone, the rubble boy is a girl, I think, her hair tossed, knotted and torn under the green shank of fibers, tubes and shells. She digs for her rubble father, I say rubble because it is indistinguishable from ice, fire, dust, clay, flesh, tears, concrete, bread, lungs, pubis, god, say rubble, say water— the rubble girl digs for her rubble mother, occupation—disinheritance—once again, I had written this somewhere, in a workshop, I think, yes, it was an afternoon of dark poets with leaves, coffee and music in the liquor light room. A rock, perhaps it's a rock, juts out, two rocks embrace each other, the shapes come to me easily, an old poetic reflex—memoria, a nation underground, that is it, the nation under-ground, that is why the rocks cover it. I forget to mention the blasts, so many things flying, light, existence, the house in tins, a mother in rags. It is too cold to expose her tiny legs, the fish-shaped back—you must take these notes for me. Before you go. See this undulate extend beyond the pools of blood. I ride the night, past the Yukon, past South Laredo, past Odessa, past the Ukraine, old Jaffa, Haifa and Istanbul, across clouds, hesitant and porous, listen— they are porous so we can glide into them, this underbelly, this underground: wound-mothers and sobbing fathers, they leave, in their ribboned flesh, shores lisp against nothingness, open—toward you, they dissolve again into my shoes— Hear the dust gong: gendarme passports, cloned maize men in C-130's, with tears bubbling on their hands, pebbles en route—we are all en route to the rubblelands. I want to chant a bliss mantra— Prajnaparamita can you hear me? I want to call for the dragon-slayer omchild. I am on my knees again. On the West Bank count the waves of skull debris—a Hebrew letter for \"love\" refuses me, an Arabic letter for \"boundary\" acknowledges me. Sit on an embankment, a dust fleece, there is a tidal wave ahead of me. It will never reach me. I live underground, under the Dead Sea, under the benevolent rocks and forearms and mortar shells and slender naked red green torsos, black, so much black. En route: this could be a train, listen: it derails into a cloud.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
At the greyhound bus stations, at airports, at silent wharfs the bodies exit the crafts. Women, men, children; cast out from the new paradise. They are not there in the homeland, in Argentina, not there in Santiago, Chile; never there in Montevideo, Uruguay, and they are not here in America They are in exile: a slow scream across a yellow bridge the jaws stretched, widening, the eyes multiplied into blood orbits, torn, whirling, spilling between two slopes; the sea, black, swallowing all prayers, shadeless. Only tall faceless figures of pain flutter across the bridge. They pace in charred suits, the hands lift, point and ache and fly at sunset as cold dark birds. They will hover over the dead ones: a family shattered by military, buried by hunger, asleep now with the eyes burning echoes calling Joaquín, María, Andrea, Joaquín, Joaquín, Andreaen exilio From here we see them, we the ones from here, not there or across, only here, without the bridge, without the arms as blue liquid quenching the secret thirst of unmarked graves, without our flesh journeying refuge or pilgrimage; not passengers on imaginary ships sailing between reef and sky, we that die here awake on Harrison Street, on Excelsior Avenue clutching the tenderness of chrome radios, whispering to the saints in supermarkets, motionless in the chasm of playgrounds, searching at 9 a.m. from our third floor cells, bowing mute, shoving the curtains with trembling speckled brown hands. Alone, we look out to the wires, the summer, to the newspaper wound in knots as matches for tenements. We that look out from our miniature vestibules, peering out from our old clothes, the father's well-sewn plaid shirt pocket, an old woman's oversized wool sweater peering out from the makeshift kitchen. We peer out to the streets, to the parades, we the ones from here not there or across, from here, only here. Where is our exile? Who has taken it?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I cut / / / / / I multiply everyday images. I apply an aluminum point. To the landscape. To the sentence. To the photo. To the figure. To the word. And suddenly, with a slight tremor of eyes, vertebrae and fingers, I destroy everything that exists. Through the years, I’ve rebuilt the cells, uncovered the signs of the cold, immaculate, academic vestibules and of the dead lips and histories in the metropolitan streets. My surgery is criminal. No one has been able to identify the skeletons, the remains, the thousand scattered nerves of personages I’ve gathered in order to bring this figure back to life. The scars are numberless and invisible. Who would suspect a grafik artist? Who would suspect this gray table as a chamber of murders? Instruments: —The pencil sleeping with its yellow blanket and rubber crown. —A magazine of memories, smiling women, men’s suits and watches like drops, like science. —Tubes of smothered ink sounding like small seas pounding a universe of plastic. —A photo of a Chamula woman looking through these windows toward the Mission. —Watercolors: French Ultramarine, Emerald Green and Windsor Violet. —Matches thin friends identical soldiers with their red helmets thinking. —Dictionaries in Portuguese, Spanish and German, white pages beasts nobody hears moaning. —The priest lantern praying with its head pointing toward the floor in front of a fierce wall. —Solemn archives organized by syllables, breaths, laughs and love with X. —A book about an artist: The Fabulous Life of Diego Rivera, printed in New York where they listen to the wind falling from the tallest building. And the X-acto knives. Triangular. The beautiful blades / / / / / Every night cars cruise the streets of 24th and Mission. A woman from San José drives a blue Chevy with smoked windows. Estela. She has reddish hair. Tight brows and dark eyes desiring everything but this street that ends in eight blocks: Potrero Avenue. She’ll have to turn. But she won’t. She won’t go back to the home of twenty years and her father who pretends to play Santa by Agustín Lara on his old guitar and the mother organizing a Jehovah’s Witnesses’ meeting. Estela will leave the car parked between Harrison Street and Alabama in San Francisco. She’ll walk aimlessly in the warmth of the produce stores, into St. Peter’s church, by the Galería de la Raza, China Books, the bakery at La Victoria. She’ll walk in the night with her eyes burning, seeing him laughing, the young man in his black box apartment, laughing, laughing, laughing like a little man. The little man laughs. It’s an apartment of marriage and fists. The wife-beater laughs in his easy chair. Next to his bed he sees the anxious note. He focuses on the signature with the E broken in three places. He looks at the stained and unmade sheets, the dull curtains, the crushed cigarettes and the ashes. The black-and-white television announces a sale of living room furniture. With his can of beer he observes. Smokes. Thinks. Within a week or two they’ll take his cousin to San Quentin prison, again. The last time he saw him he was a gardener at a college. He imagines Estela coming home. He imagines and drinks calmly. Makes the bed. Turns off the television and turns on the fm. He amuses himself in that space or cube floating above the city. Estela walks north on the Avenue. P / O / T / R / E / R / O Grafiks require precise knives. On that day When you came to bathe me I sweated that stink That only the anesthetized Can sweat.

I am merely posing for a photograph. Remember, when the Nomenclature stops you, tell them that—“Sirs, he was posing for my camera, that is all.” . . . yes, that may just work. My eyes: clear, hazel like my father’s, gaze across the sea, my hands at my side, my legs spread apart in the wet sands, my pants crumpled, torn, withered, my shirt in rags, see-through in places, no buttons, what a luxury, buttons, I laugh a little, my tongue slips and licks itself, almost, I laugh, licks itself from side to side, the corners of my mouth, if only I could talk like I used to, giggle under moonlight, to myself, my arms destitute, shrunken, I hadn’t noticed, after so many years sifting through rubble stars, rubble toys, rubble crosses, after so many decades beseeching rubble breasts—pretend I came to swim, I am here by accident, like you. My face to one side. Listen to gray-white bells of rubble, the list goes on—the bones, hearts, puffed intestines, stoned genitalia, teeth, again I forget how to piece all this together, scraps, so many scraps, lines and holes. The white gray rubble light blinds me, wait, I just thought—what if this is not visible, what if all this is not visible. Listen here, closely: I am speaking of the amber thighs still spilling nectar on the dust fleece across Gaza, the mountains, the spliced wombs across Israel, Syria. The amber serums cut across all boundaries, they smell incense, bread, honey—the color of my mother’s hands, her flesh, the shrapnel is the same color the propellers churn.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I forget the date: en route to Austin, Texas: soda on tray. Women at the computer, mexicanas learning to read and write at the same time, a workshop, we exchange stories the crossings: Hidalgo Texas Sonora Zacatecas Chihuahua—I think of my father, for a moment— I see him again, robust, alone, walks to the park, the heat dissolves the avenues. The Nomenclature cuts across the Arctic: snare the oil, gas lines, install the stations, derricks and surveillance towers, surveys, documents, classified pouches. Carry this microscopic fissure into South Asia. Diplomats—they say, so many teams of men, they orbit in silence and loud vests and helmets, they stoop with a sweetness and sift the granules, then, they rise, oblong, hunched, on fire, ready to dig into the ice, a new boundary for the national vortex, this undeclared war; the almost-uttered war, this war begins, listen. Listen closely— I hear a rap song in the distance: \"I am standin' in Lebanon watchin' everbody get it on, why am I the only one singin' this desolation song...?\"@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I walk back—nowhere, under moonlight. The dogs look as if they are angels, the ones I never imagined, with drooling silvery rays and torn behinds, yes, glowing in a strange and excited phosphor, dancing out of rhythm, racing up trees, chasing snails. This is like a children's book. O, yes, the children with rectangle heads and sack stomachs. With the eyes of Da Vinci, sad and impish, meticulous as Ibn Khaldun and taciturn as Nietzsche, phlegmatic and bitter, when they speak they leave opalescent liquids on the grasses, stuttered under a half-erased mural of Arafat, or is it Sharon, wait, the children never speak, they nod their heads, they carry huge bundles strapped across their foreheads. They weep under newspapers and roll up their skirts and wash them in the gutters, ponds, if they find them, then they run to the sea. This is where we meet, on occasion, we make up stories, we remember fruits and produce as if blessed by the plutonium blasts. \"Remember the pears, they were so green, and the avocados, like guitars, honey-golden, and the asparagus, like a lion's rainy mane, and . . .\" Our mouths water. Their mouths water, I am used to these stories. I am used to the land barren, bitten and aflame with lies. I am used to our faces in this new wild dispassionate light. I learned this from my musician friends, from years waging futile wars with poetry until I could not think of anything else.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Little Tokyo bar— ladies night, smoky gauze balcony, whispering. Tommy Becker, makes up words to “La Bamba”—request by Hard Jackson, mechanic on the left side of Paulie, oldies dancer, glowing with everything inside of her, shattered remembrances, healed in lavender nail polish, the jagged fingernail tapping. So play it hard above this floor, this velvet desert. I want the Titian ochre yeast of winter, keyboard man, fix your eyes on my eyes and tell me, handsome, how long will I live? How many double-fisted desires, crushed letters, will I lift in this terrain? And this rumbling sleeve, this ironed flint of inquisitions and imaginary executors, where shall I strike, what proud stones? Will this fauna open for me, ever, this fuzz, anointed beak inside the bartender’s mirrors, etched doves, a cautious spiral Harley tank, hissing, this Indian bead choker on Rita’s neck? How long shall we remain as wavy reflections, imitators of our own jacket’s frown? Who shall awaken first? Margo Fitzer, the waitress? I will say, Queen Margo, sing to me stoic princess of slavering hearts, three faint lines creased on your satin belly, toss our planet onto your umber lacquer tray, too empty now; make the earth spin its dog rhapsody, erotic through this silvery off-ramp and flake, unfurl. We tumble across this raceway in honey-glazed traces, our arms ahead, the hands flying to Ricky’s Ice Cream Parlour, outside. I want to own one someday, maybe on Thirty-Second Street. You will see me in my gelled waved hair, my busy wrists—so fast, a clown’s resolute gloves, dipping faster than finger painting—except I’d be stirring milk and the chocolate foam of love, churning, burning this sweet spirit, more uncertain, than the celestial sheaths above the prairie frost. See the boy coming, they chide, leaning, how he crosses his legs, his eyes dreaming, sideburns just shaved clean. He weighs the sour slate on his father’s breath; perfume, fortune, cards left on the bleeding table. Milo Wilkens, drummer at the curve, strokes his nipples with his arms as he hits the high hat. Somewhere in the back rooms, I know, a shrine, orange sponge cushions, two toilets and a wire wound wicker box, to leave flowers, occasional offerings by the Johnson County dudes, detasselers in jersey ties. Talk no more, enjoy. Darling singer, let your starry blouse sway me, steal this fresh peach half from its amber juice; I want the moon in this nectar, too. The flashing cymbals, feverish. Who can strike a votive candle, love, or sleep in this electronic night? Just listen to the two-part harmony, laughter, peeling beyond the cemetery, beyond the Iowa river—where the spike hat rooster bristles his tiny ears, bows his head, and sips from the dark canister under the carved pearl-stone. And then, returns. Let us drink, salute the bright spokes of meal, the dying wands of river blossoms, grandmother’s sacred hair; listen, her soprano owl, her bluish melody, so thin. Another glass please, we shall dance once again, our eyebrows smearing against each other’s cheekbones, loud with a Midwest sweat, a cantata from the crosshatch amp, click it. Click it, for wild kind rain, forgiving seasons, for the blushed bread of our shoulders and thighs, this night, everyone is here. Even Jeff Yoder came all the way from Illinois, to fill a bucket with passion, ruffled, thick. O sax player with a jail needle tattoo, leap onto this wet pavement, call my lonesome tempest heart, its buried mother’s kiss, bless us in staccato, with quivers of oak branch greenness, and sparrow longings riff over this brutal sky, give us your bell filled, conjure your tropic, our lover’s breath. Blues bar dancers, jangling gold popcorn, chord makers, opal-eyed Suzie in a flannel shirt; we beckon the spark, the flaring this lost body to live.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We were too Late — the waters in which people bathed Were cloudy & malignant — bellies Bloated children leaned on the twig House women stood up some sat cross- Legged under the fire rays of noon — We knew they knew the rubble land Was not theirs or ours it was stuffed into The cigarette packs of the Ladino Hacendados who kicked up their short Boots in the City of Bones below.

This is my last report: I wanted to speak of existence, the ants most of all, dressed up in their naughty flame-trousers, the exact jaws, their unknowable kindnesses, their abyss of hungers, and science, their mercilessness, their prophetic military devotions, their geometry of scent, their cocoons for the Nomenclature, I wanted to speak of the Glue Sniffers and Glue Smoothers who despise all forms unbound, loose in their amber nectars, I wanted to point to their noses, hoses and cables and networks, their tools, if I can use that word now—and scales and scanners and Glue Rectories. I wanted you to meet my broom mother who carved a hole into her womb so that I could live— At every sunset she stands under the shadow of the watchtowers elongating and denying her breath. I wanted to look under the rubble fields for once, for you (if you approved), flee into the bullet-riddled openness and fall flat, arched, askew, under the rubble sheets and let the rubble fill me with its sharp plates and ripped dust— alphabets incomplete and humid. You, listen, a little closer to the chalk dust—this child swinging her left arm, a ribbon, agitated by unnamed forces, devoured.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I do not understand why men make war. Is it because artillery is the most stoic example of what flesh can become? Is it because the military plan is the final map drawn by the wisest hunter? Is it because the neutron ray is the invincible finger no one will disobey? or Is it because the flood of blood is the proper penance workers must pay for failing tribute at the prescribed hour? I do not understand why men make war. Is it because when death is multiple and expanding, there among the odd assemblages, arbitrary and unnamed, there among the shrivelled mountains, distorted and hollow, there among the liquid farms and cities, cold and sallow, there among the splintered bones of children, women, men and cattle there and only there, the eerie head of power is being born? Is it because submission is the only gesture to be rehearsed, to be dressed, to be modeled, to be cast, to be chosen in the one and only one drama to be staged in the theater of this world, where everyone must act with the backbone humbled with the mascara of bondage, with the lipstick of slaves under the light of gentle assassination with applause piercing the ground forever? or Is it because war is the secret room of all things to be kept sealed and contained, to be conquered and renamed woman enclosed by an empire of walls, vaults, hinges and locks with the hot key that men and only men must possess for an eternal evening to visit and contemplate, to snap open a favorite window and gaze at the calibrated murder as lovers of beauty?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In a side booth at MacDonald’s before your music class you go up and down in your seat like an arpeggio under the poster of the talking hamburger: two white eyes rolling around in the top bun, the thin patty of beef imitating the tongue of its animal nature. You eat merrily. I watch the Oakland mommies, trying to understand what it means to be “single.” * Across from us, females of all ages surround the birthday girl. Her pale lace and insufficient being can’t keep them out of her circle. Stripes of yellow and brown all over the place. The poor in spirit have started to arrive, the one with thick midwestern braids twisted like thought on her head; usually she brings her mother. This week, no mother. She mouths her words anyway across the table, space-mama, time-mama, mama who should be there. * Families in line: imagine all this translated by the cry of time moving through us, this place a rubble. The gardens new generations will plant in this spot, and the food will go on in another order. This thought cheers me immensely. That we will be there together, you still seven, bending over the crops pretending to be royalty, that the huge woman with one blind eye and dots like eyes all over her dress will also be there, eating with pleasure as she eats now, right up to the tissue paper, peeling it back like bright exotic petals. * Last year, on the sun-spilled deck in Marin we ate grapes with the Russians; the KGB man fingered them quickly and dutifully, then, in a sad tone to us “We must not eat them so fast, we wait in line so long for these,” he said. * The sight of food going into a woman’s mouth made Byron sick. Food is a metaphor for existence. When Mr. Egotistical Sublime, eating the pasta, poked one finger into his mouth, he made a sound. For some, the curve of the bell pepper seems sensual but it can worry you, the slightly greasy feel of it. * The place I went with your father had an apartment to the left, and in the window, twisted like a huge bowtie, an old print bedspread. One day, when I looked over, someone was watching us, a young girl. The waiter had just brought the first thing: an orange with an avocado sliced up CCCC in an oil of forceful herbs. I couldn’t eat it. The girl’s face stood for something and from it, a little mindless daylight was reflected. The businessmen at the next table were getting off on each other and the young chardonnay. Their briefcases leaned against their ankles. I watched the young girl’s face because for an instant I had seen your face there, unterrified, unhungry, and a little disdainful. Then the waiter brought the food, bands of black seared into it like the memory of a cage. * You smile over your burger, chattering brightly. So often, at our sunny kitchen table, hearing the mantra of the refrigerator, I’ve thought there was nothing I could do but feed you; and I’ve always loved the way you eat, you eat selfishly, humming, bending the french fries to your will, your brown eyes spotting everything: the tall boy who has come in with his mother, repressed rage in espadrilles, and now carries the tray for her. Oh this is fun, says the mother, You stand there with mommy’s purse. And he stands there smiling after her, holding all the patience in the world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A brenda is missing—where is she? Summon the seeds & weeds, the desert whooshes. Phone the finch with the crowded beak; a little pretenda is learning to read in the afternoon near the cactus caves. Near oleander & pulpy caves with the click-click of the wren & the shkrrrr of the thrasher, a skinny pretenda is learning to read till the missing brenda is found. Drip of syllables like olives near the saguaro. Nancy Drew will find the secret in raincoats & wednesdays & sticks. Nancy whose spine is yellow or blue will find the brenda in 1962, Nancy who has no mother, who takes suggestions from her father & ignores them. Gleam goes the wren ignoring the thorn. They cannot tell the difference. Click of the smart dog’s nails on linoleum. Nancy bends over the clues, of brenda’s locket & dress. Word by word between syllables a clue. Where has the summer gone, the autumn— are they missing too? Maybe Nancy will parse the secret & read the book report on Nancy Drew: “neat pretty sly cute.” Syllable by syllable & still no brenda! Nancy puts her hand to her forehead; is the missing girl in the iron bird? is the clue to the girl in the locket?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

—Once more the poem woke me up, the dark poem. I was ready for it; he was sleeping, and across the cabin, the small furnace lit and re-lit itself—the flame a yellow “tongue” again, the metal benignly hard again; and a thousand insects outside called and made me nothing; moonlight streamed inside as if it had been ... I looked around, I thought of the lower wisdom, spirit held by matter: Mary, white as a sand dollar, and Christ, his sticky halo tilted— oh, to get behind it! The world had been created to comprehend itself as matter: table, the torn veils of spiders ... Even consciousness— missing my love— was matter, the metal box of a furnace. As the obligated flame, so burned my life ... What is the meaning of this suffering I asked and the voice—not Christ but between us— said you are the meaning. No no, I replied, That is the shape, what is the meaning. You are the meaning, it said—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The earth had wanted us all to itself. The mountains wanted us back for themselves. The numbered valleys of serpentine wanted us; that’s why it happened as it did, the split as if one slow gear turned beneath us. . . Then the Tuesday shoppers paused in the street and the tube that held the trout-colored train and the cords of action from triangular buildings and the terraced gardens that held camelias shook and shook, each flower a single thought. Mothers and children took cover under tables. I called out to her who was my life. From under the table—I hid under the table that held the begonia with the fiery stem, the stem that had been trying to root, that paused in its effort—I called to the child who was my life. And understood, in the endless instant before she answered, how Pharaoh’s army, seeing the ground break open, seeing the first fringed horses fall into the gap, made their vows, that each heart changes, faced with a single awe and in that moment a promise is written out. However we remember California later the earth we loved will know the truth: that it wanted us back for itself with our mighty forms and our specific longings, wanted them to be air and fire but they wouldn’t; the kestrel circled over a pine, which lasted, the towhee who loved freedom, gathering seed during the shaking lasted, the painting released by the wall, the mark and hook we placed on the wall, and the nail, and the memory of driving the nail in, these also lasted—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We bury the sparrows of Europe with found instruments, their breasts light as an ounce of tea where we had seen them off the path, their twin speeds of shyness & notched wings near the pawnbroker’s house by the canal, in average neighborhoods of the resisters, or in markets of princely delphinium & flax, flying from awnings at unmarked rates to fetch crumbs from our table half-spinning back to clefs of grillwork on external stairs we would descend much later; in rainy neighborhoods of the resisters where streets were taken one by one, where consciousness is a stair or path, we mark their domains with notched sticks of hickory or chestnut or ash because our cities of princely pallor should not have unmarked graves. Lyric work, flight of arch, death bridge to which patterned being is parallel: they came as if from the margins of a painting, their average hearts half-spinning our little hourglass up on the screen.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The labeled bins on the California hillside catch the glint and quarter-glint of passing cars. Families pull up with their interesting trash and start unloading: Here, sweetheart, this goes over in Newspaper. The bundle hits with a thud. Diet soda cans spin almost noiselessly down, and the sun- permitting bottles from a day’s pleasure are tossed into Mixed Glass by the children who like to hear the smash, unknowable, chaotic, as matter greets itself and starts to change. What mystery is inside a thing! If we peered into the bin, we could see it waiting there, could believe everything is alive and specific and personal, could tell by the tilt of one bottle against the next that it’s difficult to be singular, to have identity, to keep an outline safe in the terrors of space. Even the child knows this. Bye, bottle! she shouts, tossing it in; and the bottle lies there in the two o’clock position, temporarily itself, before being swept into the destiny of mixture. . . And what if some don’t want to. What if some items in the piles of paper, the orange and blue envelopes from a magazine sweepstakes, numbers pressing through the cloudy windows with our names, some among those pale sheets curled with moisture, would rather stay as they are. It’s spring; we’ve thrown away mistakes— tax forms, recipes, tennis-ball-sized drafts of poems—that which was blank shall be made blank again—but what if that failed letter wants to be a failure, not go back to pulp, and thought .. . Or across the parking lot, where light insists on changing the dull cans, a few cans don’t want to be changed, though they should want to, shouldn’t they, should want to be changed by light, light which is called sweet reason, honeyed, spectra, magnitude, light that goes from the parking lot looking helpless though it is matter that has been betrayed. . . All afternoon the bins are carried off by those who know about where things should go, who are used to the clatter the cans make, pouring out; and the families, who believed change would heal them are pulling away in their vans, slightly embarrassed by that which refused . . . The bins fill again with hard substances, the hills bear down with their fugitive gold, the pampas grass bending low to protect what was briefly certain and alive with hope.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Often visitors there, saddened by lack of trees, go out to a promontory. Then, backed by the banded sunset, the trail of the Conquistadores, the father puts on the camera, the leather albatross, and has the children imitate saguaros. One at a time they stand there smiling, fingers up like the tines of a fork while the stately saguaro goes on being entered by wrens, diseases, and sunlight. The mother sits on a rock, arms folded across her breasts. To her the cactus looks scared, its needles like hair in cartoons. With its arms in preacher or waltz position, it gives the impression of great effort in every direction, like the mother. Thousands of these gray-green cacti cross the valley: nature repeating itself, children repeating nature, father repeating children and mother watching. Later, the children think the cactus was moral, had something to teach them, some survival technique or just regular beauty. But what else could it do? The only protection against death was to love solitude.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The shoe repairman works behind the married shoes, his whole hand inside the boot he’s shining, everything cozy in the glass displays, laces paired on gravel he’s spread out in the window, shoes placed as though they’re walking, and beside them propped up, the wooden tongues of shoe horns, poised to serve the inanimate world ... He comes out mildly attentive, soft accent, possibly a Scottish childhood, possibly sheep to tend ... Clear day, first summer divorced in Berkeley, a time of seamless, indescribable grief; he waits kindly in his blue apron, fingering the well-worn inner sole, and I am grateful for those who serve us knowing nothing of our lives ... * The cleaner waits behind the silver bell; he’s from Cambodia and has free Christian literature on the counter. He greets me with pleasant chatter, searches through the coats, some left for years, he says; they make a soft blue whistle as they circulate on the ovals like the ones under those automatic boats. As the clothes pass, little checks and prints under the whooshing of motion, I see my husband’s coat— how long will I call him my husband—like an old friend passing by quickly not bothering to greet me. Odd now, I don’t have to pick it up, the serious plaid will go around between the women’s suits and stay all night. . . * I watch the young butcher flipping over the young chicken: he takes one wing and sort of spins it, first on its back, flinging the trimmed, watery lemon-colored fat into the trash, then before he starts on the legs he puts his hand so deeply in that the finger comes out the neck ... The other butcher sets the slab of beef under the saw: the riveting intricate swirl as the dead flesh pulls away; he goes off, shouts short words from the deep freeze— to me or to the carcass hanging by the shank?— I can wait, but the spaces can’t, there’s a slight ticking, then the carcass swings and swings ... Somehow I thought we would know everything through the flesh. Perhaps. But my days have become spirit. The young butcher splits the chicken down the back, seems to enjoy the crack of the knife as it enters the bone, so I try to. Housewives lean against the cool glass to convey holiday news and he responds without really looking up; I love that. * oh Berkeley summer mornings, aren’t they— what? past the French Hotel, the glint of tiny spoons so briefly and soberly allowed to rest on white saucers, the plums just about over, the agapanthus—“lilies of denial”— in the center dividers, blooming, or just about to— like me, hearty and hesitant, not wanting to write it, not wanting to ruin the perfection of the poem by writing it . . . At the dentist, the little mirror, the dinosaur prong is put into the mouth. Mouth: the first darkness. Nearby: the mobile with straw eyeless fishes. The dentist will go home to her family, having briefly reached inside the visible mystery and found nothing ... I imagine Wisdom in the text is like this, creating the cosmos from the mind of God, looking interested and competent; she touches the physical place with her prong, and the pain shines ...

I passed through nature into the next. Children running in unsupervised shadows. Last century’s fountains learning not to lie. Risk to identify with only one element since one will die but in the summer air around each thought, something is built and avoided. You go through an arch and aren’t the arch, just infinity of form, curve’s curve of becoming, a phrase tracking it to future’s celadon relief. As others dressed as others we were supposed to meet.

The problem of time. Of there not being enough of it. My girl came to the study and said Help me; I told her I had a time problem which meant: I would die for you but I don’t have ten minutes. Numbers hung in the math book like motel coathangers. The Lean Cuisine was burning like an ancient city: black at the edges, bubbly earth tones in the center. The latest thing they’re saying is lack of time might be a “woman’s problem.” She sat there with her math book sobbing— (turned out to be prime factoring: whole numbers dangle in little nooses) Hawking says if you back up far enough it’s not even an issue, time falls away into 'the curve' which is finite, boundaryless. Appointment book, soprano telephone— (beep End beep went the microwave) The hands fell off my watch in the night. I spoke to the spirit who took them, told her: Time is the funniest thing they invented. Had wakened from a big dream of love in a boat No time to get the watch fixed so the blank face lived for months in my dresser, no arrows for hands, just quartz intentions, just the pinocchio nose (before the lie) left in the center; the watch didn’t have twenty minutes; neither did I. My girl was doing her gym clothes by herself; (red leaked toward black, then into the white insignia) I was grading papers, heard her call from the laundry room: Mama? Hawking says there are two types of it, real and imaginary (imaginary time must be like decaf), says it’s meaningless to decide which is which but I say: there was tomorrow- and-a-half when I started thinking about it; now there’s less than a day. More done. That’s the thing that keeps being said. I thought I could get more done as in: fish stew from a book. As in: Versateller archon, then push-push-push the tired-tired around the track like a planet. Legs, remember him? Our love—when we stagger—lies down inside us. . . Hawking says there are little folds in time (actually he calls them wormholes) but I say: there’s a universe beyond where they’re hammering the brass cut-outs .. . Push us out in the boat and leave time here— (because: where in the plan was it written, You’ll be too busy to close parentheses, the snapdragon’s bunchy mouth needs water, even the caterpillar will hurry past you? Pulled the travel alarm to my face: the black behind the phosphorous argument kept the dark from being ruined. Opened the art book —saw the languorous wrists of the lady in Tissot’s “Summer Evening.” Relaxed. Turning gently. The glove (just slightly—but still:) “aghast”; opened Hawking, he says, time gets smoothed into a fourth dimension but I say space thought it up, as in: Let’s make a baby space, and then it missed. Were seconds born early, and why didn’t things unhappen also, such as the tree became Daphne. . . At the beginning of harvest, we felt the seven directions. Time did not visit us. We slept till noon. With one voice I called him, with one voice I let him sleep, remembering summer years ago, I had come to visit him in the house of last straws and when he returned above the garden of pears, he said our weeping caused the dew. . . I have borrowed the little boat and I say to him Come into the little boat, you were happy there; the evening reverses itself, we’ll push out onto the pond, or onto the reflection of the pond, whichever one is eternal@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In movies when the hero is about to die, He scatters a few phrases in a place like this, Hoping the words will come up again Immortal, or the grasses will reach out for him As now they do for us. Someone has planted a row of little trees To stop the wind. Instead they’ve learned To bend like the elect In one direction only; they know The sea will shatter them. Isn’t it always like this? Something uncontrollable becomes the hero, Taking off its dress, the ice plants Sunburn from the center out So we can see that their deaths Of splendid rust and yellow are not ours, We are allowed again the glare Of the sand, the druid hills, The grasses brushing the legs, though Just to have felt it once would have been enough.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Noted to be the definitive bright morning of 10,000 calendars. The church bell melted. Rage of unrequited love became a terrible serpent. The morning star lowered like an enemy’s flag. A vampire’s mattress tumbled out at the outskirts of town. Ancient lanterns, suddenly thrown through the air, somewhere deep in the mountains. That night, in a snowy rural area, an elderly, powder-faced woman appeared on doorsteps in search of wine. Her origins, neatly wrapped in the cold dressing of a snowflake’s breath.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Spanish captive, Hoahwah, married twin sisters. The one wife called Double turned into a snake after eating a nest of glossy eggs. Snake Woman still lives on Mt. Scott, sleeps facing west. The sun a white skull itself bathes her on the cedar breaks. In rectangular dreams she calls the young men grandson. The other sister Tsi-yee, named after a war deed (her father charged a cavalry office knocked him off his horse then lanced him to the prairie) bore three children: Tabe titah, Namnetse, and Sam Hoahwah. Lena, Sam Hoahwah’s favorite daughter ran off with an Arapaho from Canton. Sam sent his men after her on horseback, their ranch-hand-shadows overcast the Cheyenne and Arapaho Rez. Lena said: I ain’t comin back. She bled to death on a mattress after a miscarriage. Mother couldn’t remember Lena just the car ride to Post Oak Cemetery and watching wind in the pinwheels. Mother died the same age, fish-tailing into Comanche history in a Chevy Z-28 without car insurance. Great grandfather Sam Hoahwah first Indian in southwest Oklahoma to own a car got run over with his own Model-T. His Mexican cowboy-chauffeur forgot to take it out of gear when Sam crank-started the car. Not far from his own car, Uncle Fredrick was found dead in the weeds of Cache Road, keys missing. He sang gospels in Comanche, and backup on Robby Robertson’sContact from the Underworld of RedBoy. (Uncle liked Levon Helm better.) Frederick Jr. caught ghost sickness bicycling across Post Oak Cemetery at night. He looked past his shoulder it twisted his face. The moon mocks him now. After the incident, his girlfriend fell in love with his cousin Rusty nicknamed Rabbit who loves fried baloney and calls it Indian Steak. Rabbit’s younger brother paints abstract horse murals in empty swimming pools, and images of a 20 foot long red talking snake who calls him grandson in his dreams.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The Ozarks are where defeated assassins, the unholy, and monsters come to retire. The proper soil and crooked moonlight grow back the disemboweled, the decapitated, while we collect arrears in child support for our demi-god children. The procession of taillights lined deep down the logging trails. Along the way, there was a gentleman arguing with his soul over his suicide. I, tongue of snakes. Cut up, dipped in powdered sugar, scattered to the ants in the deepest corner of Mt. Nebo as an insult, bind my ghost to the mountain. Typhoon collected the few precious scales left of me from the undertow. My southern accent-muscle burned up from haunting your life/house. Now, let daybreak be my head and the year, my whole body. An online southern Christian university ordained my smoker’s cough to be a dove. My favorite exorcism: The demon, steeped in corn bread philosophy, does not have enough ass to carry off the jeans he advertises as he kneels down to the priest and holy water. Years ago, as a child, I climbed the levee and made a hole in the air. That’s where I will rest, but the gate is not wide enough. Like my burial site, I am party-size.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the month of cleaning family plots, I learned football among graves. All summer, fangs were plentiful. I fed only on fruit and acorns next to a nest built in a discarded doll marking the 50-yard line. From snakes licking my ears, sounds of trees, and whispers from the dead, I learned to read plays by how the opposing team huddled. On the field, I gave the appearance of lightning, a wardrobe of open wounds. Magical goon who knew a love that outlasted bottles of tequila and all the Cure albums. It, too, was true.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The wagon and mule, Time and Eternity, stop to change places. Their lean and slope-back shadow, my reservation. The moon moves like infested flour. At the river, bloody victories meet bloody massacres. They tell each other about their dead. Grandmothers eat buffalo instead of hamburger. After supper, guitar chords bite through gravestone. Then the one grandfather interrupts, walking off with his own skull as a lantern into the polar night. Snowshoe hare cleans the ears of the sleeping and leaves prophetic dreams. It is quiet. One can hear the hair of the dead grow. The woods, itself, dressed in frozen children’s clothes. Few of the living disguise themselves as pawned beadwork.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Velroy de-jays the séance-turntables, spinning black water, scratching out full moons with red and blue curves of hip hop. In the dance club, bodies are a collection of sunrise songs in reverse. Corey wears her cat-eye contacts and no panties. There’s the bathroom-stall eagle medicine with Ecstasy placed on the tongue. She handles the lace like a Kiowa church hymn. Dee is Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, Kiowa, and Fort Sill Apache. He couldn’t enroll into any tribe but he can grass dance, bump and grind, and do the Jerry Lewis. Black girls love him. Stoney has four wives, Indian way. He has ghost medicine and carries a small white ball of clay. He sells peyote and coke to the white boys. I have a southern accent. I killed a Lakota man, he was a Rollin ’20. It was with a shotgun. It was powwow season, I fancy danced.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Severed finger of a convicted murderer uncurls like a waking pet. Demonic compass points toward the most dangerous direction to get home. Its long yellow fingernail can pick any lock. On the fishhook, the finger resembles a long, fat mealworm. Most times, it’s lodged in the throats of my enemies or hiding among the tampons of cops’ wives. It avoids gold rings, bad luck. When wearing this rot relic on a chain, sunlight smells like stale curtains in a worn-out hearse. Rain never hits my clothes. Rooms seem hotter. Radios turn on by themselves, always to the same Lucinda Williams song. Use any mirror as a doorway, I come out into the same sweaty bedroom from a previous life. I forget who is wearing whom. I pierce the fingertip to draw up a will. I dip the finger in water. I point it toward the sun. I flick it to make it rain. Hanging on the wall, I sleep under this bird, booger-picker, dream catcher, missing piece of an inverted crucifix, rotting pencil. It sleeps over me like an accusative God. Around midnight, I wake up, the finger is typing in the next room. What is it composing at this time of night? Letters to a parole board, love letters to the rest of the hand, midnight sermons, ransom notes pertaining to me, memoirs about life, hanging from my neck ...@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
. . . makes a noisy entry into Texas like tumbling file cabinets. Four mountains Four creeks Four forts Four suns Four seasons Four nations—Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho * At Yellow House Canyon the river turns tight. Talons skim the water, waves confirm dawn. With white sheets tied around their waists Tonkawa scouts cannibalistically count out a bag of children’s hands. Seated in a silver Concho saddle, Death’s dirty sergeant lights up his ceremonial breathing leaf. * Where Cache Creek empties into the Red River is a nerve center of war. There Velroy fought the gruesome brotherhood: Blue Corpse, Smallpox, and the Creeper, cruel 300 lb nymphs. They tried to strip his body of Carbon-14 atoms. Velroy, knowledgeable in the Flying Crane Technique of Kung-Fu, drop-kicked Blue Corpse in the windpipe simultaneously breaking his neck in three places. He tricked The Creeper with his own taboo. By passing wolf’s milk and tequila through a hole in an oak tree, it made The Creeper vomit up his own stomach. Velroy quickly buried it, turning him into a tree. Smallpox challenged Velroy to a dance-off. It took place on top of the creek. While Smallpox was doing a head spin, Velroy pulled the cardboard out from under him. Smallpox dropped into the water and drowned. * Snake Woman sits in the deep, a cinema of silver scales. Her hair moves like meadow grass in flood water. * Members of the Black Knife Society crossed the south fork of the river on horseback in a V-formation. They possess gear simultaneously musical and military: a stretched skin to serve as both shield and drum, and a club, sword, or lance that is also a drumstick. * At the Red River Ute chief cuts my guitar strings Ute women love Punk@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My ancestors were not diligent and so they lived beside the fort that's neither on the maps of Heaven, Nor of Hell. In these lands, there is no difference between a star and thrown car keys. Chicken nuggets hatch from the eggs of eagles. I grow dirty while bathing in bottled water. My bed comforter is a wet parking lot, I wrap myself up in. If I eat in the morning, there's nothing left in the evening My dish of grass and cigarette butts topped with expired coupons. Stir all I like; I never swallow it down. All the while, my rabbit's foot runs about from Las Cruces to West Memphis searching for flawless luck. The more one cries, the more one prospers . . . O' ancestral demon, may my lamentation become verbal sorcery.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This is the deepest part of the world. Bird don’t fly here,but there is the sound of wings. The smell, just a struggle in the earthunderneath the musty floorboards. Monsters hatch fully-grown from their eggs.Snaky legs indicate chaos. I carry sad omens, slobber down the psychic’s legsto her feet pointed backwards. I roll off the back of a skull strapped on topof a fox who shape-shifts into the irresistible. A Christian, Oklahoma-shaped and melancholic,caught at the entrance of a ditch as the best breath of me tornadoes into the next county.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I lov’d thee from the earliest dawn, When first I saw thy beauty’s ray, And will, until life’s eve comes on, And beauty’s blossom fades away; And when all things go well with thee, With smiles and tears remember me. I’ll love thee when thy morn is past, And wheedling gallantry is o’er, When youth is lost in age’s blast, And beauty can ascend no more, And when life’s journey ends with thee, O, then look back and think of me. I’ll love thee with a smile or frown, ’Mid sorrow’s gloom or pleasure’s light, And when the chain of life runs down, Pursue thy last eternal flight, When thou hast spread thy wing to flee, Still, still, a moment wait for me. I’ll love thee for those sparkling eyes, To which my fondness was betray’d, Bearing the tincture of the skies, To glow when other beauties fade, And when they sink too low to see, Reflect an azure beam on me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I feel myself in need Of the inspiring strains of ancient lore, My heart to lift, my empty mind to feed, And all the world explore. I know that I am old And never can recover what is past, But for the future may some light unfold And soar from ages blast. I feel resolved to try, My wish to prove, my calling to pursue, Or mount up from the earth into the sky, To show what Heaven can do. My genius from a boy, Has fluttered like a bird within my heart; But could not thus confined her powers employ, Impatient to depart. She like a restless bird, Would spread her wing, her power to be unfurl’d, And let her songs be loudly heard, And dart from world to world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Like heart-loving brothers we meet, And still the loud thunders of strife, The blaze of fraternity kindles most sweet, There’s nothing more pleasing in life. The black cloud of faction retreats, The poor is no longer depressed, See those once discarded resuming their seats, The lost strangers soon will find rest. The soldier no longer shall roam, But soon shall land safely ashore, Each soon will arrive at his own native home, And struggle in warfare no more. The union of brothers is sweet, Whose wives and children do come, Their sons and fair daughters with pleasure they greet, When long absent fathers come home. They never shall languish again, Nor discord their union shall break, When brothers no longer lament and complain, Hence never each other forsake. Hang closely together like friends, By peace killing foes never driven, The storm of commotion eternally ends, And earth will soon turn into Heaven.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He is gone, the strong base of the nation, The dove to his covet has fled; Ye heroes lament his privation, For Lincoln is dead. He is gone down, the sun of the Union, Like Phoebus, that sets in the west; The planet of peace and communion, Forever has gone to his rest. He is gone down from a world of commotion, No equal succeeds in his stead; His wonders extend with the ocean, Whose waves murmur, Lincoln is dead. He is gone and can ne’er be forgotten, Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom; When gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten, His deeds will break forth from the tomb. He is gone out of glory to glory, A smile with the tear may be shed, O, then let us tell the sweet story, Triumphantly, Lincoln is dead.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Alas! and am I born for this, To wear this slavish chain? Deprived of all created bliss, Through hardship, toil and pain! How long have I in bondage lain, And languished to be free! Alas! and must I still complain— Deprived of liberty. Oh, Heaven! and is there no relief This side the silent grave— To soothe the pain—to quell the grief And anguish of a slave? Come Liberty, thou cheerful sound, Roll through my ravished ears! Come, let my grief in joys be drowned, And drive away my fears. Say unto foul oppression, Cease: Ye tyrants rage no more, And let the joyful trump of peace, Now bid the vassal soar. Soar on the pinions of that dove Which long has cooed for thee, And breathed her notes from Afric’s grove, The sound of Liberty. Oh, Liberty! thou golden prize, So often sought by blood— We crave thy sacred sun to rise, The gift of nature’s God! Bid Slavery hide her haggard face, And barbarism fly: I scorn to see the sad disgrace In which enslaved I lie. Dear Liberty! upon thy breast, I languish to respire; And like the Swan unto her nest, I’d like to thy smiles retire. Oh, blest asylum—heavenly balm! Unto thy boughs I flee— And in thy shades the storm shall calm, With songs of Liberty!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Esteville begins to burn; The auburn fields of harvest rise; The torrid flames again return, And thunders roll along the skies. Perspiring Cancer lifts his head, And roars terrific from on high; Whose voice the timid creatures dread; From which they strive with awe to fly. The night-hawk ventures from his cell, And starts his note in evening air; He feels the heat his bosom swell, Which drives away the gloom of fear. Thou noisy insect, start thy drum; Rise lamp-like bugs to light the train; And bid sweet Philomela come, And sound in front the nightly strain. The bee begins her ceaseless hum, And doth with sweet exertions rise; And with delight she stores her comb, And well her rising stock supplies. Let sportive children well beware, While sprightly frisking o’er the green; And carefully avoid the snare, Which lurks beneath the smiling scene. The mistress bird assumes her nest, And broods in silence on the tree, Her note to cease, her wings at rest, She patient waits her young to see.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What sudden ill the world await, From my dear residence I roam; I must deplore the bitter fate, To straggle from my native home. The verdant willow droops her head, And seems to bid a fare thee well; The flowers with tears their fragrance shed, Alas! their parting tale to tell. ’Tis like the loss of Paradise, Or Eden’s garden left in gloom, Where grief affords us no device; Such is thy lot, my native home. I never, never shall forget My sad departure far away, Until the sun of life is set, And leaves behind no beam of day. How can I from my seat remove And leave my ever devoted home, And the dear garden which I love, The beauty of my native home? Alas! sequestered, set aside, It is a mournful tale to tell; ’Tis like a lone deserted bride That bade her bridegroom fare thee well. I trust I soon shall dry the tear And leave forever hence to roam, Far from a residence so dear, The place of beauty—my native home.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Weep for the country in its present state,And of the gloom which still the future waits;The proud confederate eagle heard the sound,And with her flight fell prostrate to the ground!Weep for the loss the country has sustained,By which her now dependent is in jail;The grief of him who now the war survived,The conscript husbands and the weeping wives!Weep for the seas of blood the battle cost,And souls that ever hope forever lost!The ravage of the field with no recruit,Trees by the vengeance blasted to the root!Weep for the downfall o'er your heads and chief,Who sunk without a medium of relief;Who fell beneath the hatchet of their pride,Then like the serpent bit themselves and died!Weep for the downfall of your president,Who far too late his folly must repent;Who like the dragon did all heaven assail,And dragged his friends to limbo with his tail!Weep o'er peculiar swelling coffers void,Our treasures left, and all their banks destroyed;Their foundless notes replete with shame to all,Expecting every day their final fall,In quest of profit never to be won,Then sadly fallen and forever down!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

From raindrenched Homeland into a well: the upturned animal was mine by law and outside the tunnel, him again! Everywhere I turned the children ran between. “Loose dogs!” he roared. I remember one sequence: a gulf in his thinking meant swim as fast as you can. But it was winter and the water was closed. The mouths of the children were sealed with ice. After all, we were swimming in emotion, not water. “Shut up! you Father!” I shouted over my shoulder. Racing, but not spent, my mind went, “It isn’t good that the human being is all I have to go by .... It isn’t good that I know who I love but not who I trust .... It isn’t good that I can run to a priest but not to a plane .... I lost my way exactly like this.” Inverted tunnel of the self. Throat or genital search for the self. Light that goes on in the self when the eyes are shut. Uniformity impossible in the psyche’s pre-self like a day never spent, or how the unseen can make itself felt. It was as if a boy was calling from the end of a long island. Docks were vertical and warlike. I would be on one side of my bed like a mother who can tell she’s a comfort because she’s called Mother. Still, we both would be able to see the edge of the problem. It’s true that the person is also a thing. When you are running you know the texture. I was clawing at the palm of one hand and brushing up my blues with the other. A man who wore his boxers at night remarked that my daughter was tired. He had nothing to do with anything. Ahead was the one with magnified eyes and historical data to last. Know-how and the hysteria to accomplish his whole life. It was horrible what we would do for peace. We told him the story of the suffering he made us feel with the ingratiating stoop of those who came second in the world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

And prefers to be caught naked With his bow and arrow. Embellishes But clears the way for pathos. — From above I covet a mountain beneath my feet.

Coyote scruff in canyons off Mulholland Drive. Fragrance of sage and rosemary, now it’s spring. At night the mockingbirds ring their warnings of cats coming across the neighborhoods. Like castanets in the palms of a dancer, the palm trees clack. The HOLLYWOOD sign has a white skin of fog across it where erotic canyons hump, moisten, slide, dry up, swell, and shift. They appear impatient—to make such powerful contact with pleasure that they will toss back the entire cover of earth. She walks for days around brown trails, threading sometimes under the low branches of bay and acacia. Bitter flowers will catch her eye: pink and thin honeysuckle, or mock orange. They coat the branches like lace in the back of a mystical store. Other deviant men and women live at the base of these canyons, closer to the city however. Her mouth is often dry, her chest tight, but she is filled to the brim with excess idolatry. It was like a flat mouse—the whole of Los Angeles she could hold in the circle formed by her thumb and forefinger. Tires were planted to stop the flow of mud at her feet. But she could see all the way to Long Beach through a tunnel made in her fist. Her quest for the perfect place was only a symptom of the same infection that was out there, a mild one, but a symptom nonetheless.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I traveled to the page where scripture meets fiction.The paper slept but the night in me woke up.Black letters were now aliveand collectible in a material crawl.I could not decipher their intentions anymore.To what end did their shapes come forth?To seduce or speak truth?While birds swept over the water like pot-bellied angels beautiful bells rang to assist the hoist.Up they went to slake their thirst, drinking from the mistfor the sound of bells seemed to freeas well as hold them.Then down to scavenge the surfand eat the innocent.“I love God and the ferry too,” wrote Kerouac.Only that which exists can be spoken of.* * * I wonder, will our imagination remain a temple burning with candlesagainst all odds? Behind a nipple and a bone?The simplest of glands laid in a circle around skin and liquidthat stirs up imagerywinged and prismed, as if bloodwere a wine inducing visions* * * Some people cry when the characters die.

Are you even looking at the earth?Remember the map is flat but everything else is not.Is the newest child the oldest body in creation?Does he carry more information than his mother?Does her mother, his grandmother, do I seem redundantby having arrived with less, though first?Is that why I read at night with my lips compressed?* * * The fact is, I never knew if anyone felt methe way Nijinsky knew how to feel.Or Nastasya. Nothing could shock that womanwho had done so much wrong.As if trained in a theater, multiple personalitiesstreamed from her tongue.This made her an exemplar for our time.She knew how others felt and became each one,forgetting who she was before.I remember her as a child.

The hotel bar downstairs was dirty and dark and almost empty except for him whom I didn’t know I lost my balance because evil is aroused by absence Outside on the island a brick city had grown up and old A person could only nibble on its shadows Where was my beloved?

The stroll from my cell along the path above the donkeys past a door open, a door shut and a strong smell of wood and cigarettes ends where music helps white marguerites cut through the masonry. * Dark for words with a clicking wren a yellow tit and over the clover a shovel and a rustle of grain. He’s training calves with shouts and food to follow him to another field before the second bell. * Broom loops over the buttercups. These names give birth to cones and needles, ferns with mini-sacs of pollen attached. It only takes one shot of spittle on green for my brother to explain the sexual life of the forest and honeybees. * Simon says he would like to live alone in a cottage with a garden, no humans, no obligations.

There is no Rescue Mission where it isn’t freezing from the need that created it. The lost children distill to pure chemical. Where Good is called No-Tone it’s the one who cries out who doesn’t get a coat. The children fuse colors because they don’t want to separate. Daughters shot off of hydrants who cut each other in the neck and gut, don’t care which one of them will end up later in surgery. And drugged sons pretending to be costumes, well, they’re not welcome to comprehension either. Why does a wild child confuse a moon with a hole in his skin? One was born soaked in gin. His first sip was from a bottle of denial. What can “leave me alone” mean after that? The system is settled, dimensions fixed. Another one’s hand feels like a starfish. Makes me hysterical like the word perestroika. But they all dig the way the pepper is rosy in the vodka. It’s verbocity that creates jokers. Brick and grit are the candy and frosting where volunteers and teachers write cards that go: “Donate books that say NOT and NO and poets who say Urn instead of Oh.” How do the children convert their troubles into hip-hop?

Feathers fluffed the ashtray bin at the bottom of the elevator. Feathers and a smeared black look littered the parking lot like mascara. A cage would glide back and let them out to merge with the other cars on La Brea. It looked as if a struggle had ended in tears between the bird and an enemy. She broke through the fear to examine it. No chicken claws, or comb, no wing, no egg. The neutrality of words like “nothing” and “silence” vibrated at her back like plastic drapes. How could there be a word for silence? A child’s lips might blow, the North wind bring snow, a few stars explode, boats rock, but whatever moved in air did not by necessity move in ears and require the word “silence” therefore. She had personally sunk to a level where she could produce thought, and only “violence” remained a problem. It was common in her circle. A bush could turn into a fire, or a face at a clap of the hand could release spit and infection. The deviants were like herself unable to control their feelings. Los Angeles for them was only hostile as a real situation during the rainy season when torrents ripped down the sides of the canyons and overnight turned them sloshy. Then they hid in underground places, carrying Must the Morgue be my Only Shelter?? signs. But the rest of the time the sort of whiteness spread out by a Southland sun kept them warm, and they could shit whenever they wanted to, in those places they had long ago staked out. My personal angel is my maid, said one to another, putting down his Rilke with a gentle smile.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It seemed as if we did not sleep One wink that night; I was sighing deep. The cruellest judge in the costliest court Could not condemn a night so short. We had the light out, but I know, Each time I turned, a radiant glow Suffused the room, and shining snow Alit from Heaven’s candle-fires Illuminated our desires. But the last time I held her, strong, Excited, closest, very long, Something started to go wrong. The edge of dawn’s despotic veil Showed at the eastern window-pale And there it was,—the morning light! Gwen was seized with a fearful fright, Became an apparition, cried, “Get up, go now with God, go hide! “Love is a salt, a gall, a rue, A vinegar-vintage. Dos y Ddw, Vaya con Dios, quickly, too!” “Ah, not yet, never yet, my love; The stars and moon still shine above.” “Then why do the raucous ravens talk With such a loud insistent squawk?” “Crows always cry like that, when fleas Nibble their ankles, nip their knees.” “And why do the dogs yip, yammer, yell?” “They think they’ve caught a fox’s smell.” “Poet, the wisdom of a fool Offers poor counsel as a rule. Open the door, open it wide As fast as you can, and leap outside. The dogs are fierce when they get untied.” “The woods are only a bound from here, And I can outjump a deer, my dear!” “But tell me, best beloved of men, Will you come again? Will you come again?” “Gwen, you know I’m your nightingale, And I’ll be with you, without fail, When the cloud is cloak, and the dark is sky, And when the night comes, so will I.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The first sentence is a sentence about writing. The second sentence tells you it's alright to lose interest. You might be one of those people who sits back in his or her chair without interest, and this would have been the third sentence you would have read. The fourth sentence, what does that say, that says something about how I genuinely feel, even if it no longer matters how I genuinely feel, that has not even become the topic of another book. The fifth sentence says that that was left by the wayside because it was such a variable thing. That's what the sixth sentence said, and says, that it sits there still, varying, changing its colors, etc., the army of ancient Rome marches by, they think it is some sort of tomb and display their eagle insignia. The seventh sentence ill conceals its surprise that I should have tried to make it all look so far away. The eight sentence is therefore a meditation on something close at hand. The ninth sentence is a means of approach. In the tenth sentence I discover I am staring at a list of things I have done written in blue pencil on brown paper. In the eleventh sentence I draw a one-eyed duck on the paper beside the list. In the twelfth sentence I circle one of the numbers on the list and I start to feel nervous. In the thirteenth sentence I realize I have chosen something. In the fourteenth sentence I decide I will read my choice aloud. In the fifteenth sentence I stall by saying the words \"I don't have a choice.\" In the sixteenth sentence I stall again by thinking about the obelisk on the Upper East Side in Central Park and how it is called \"Cleopatra's Needle,\" and how around the base of the \"needle\" there are metal supports in the shape of crustaceans, I think they are crabs in fact but sometimes that word is slightly obscene so I consider not writing it. In the seventeenth sentence I think some more about the kinds of joke that employ that word and whether it is worth thinking about such jokes, as it does alter the genre of what you are writing if such things are allowed to be thought as a part of it. The lawns of the park were very green in summer, and it is early summer right now, right as I think to think this, and this is the first time I have lived in New York City for a full year in ten years, this is what I tell as the nineteenth sentence. In the twentieth sentence I recall the list and resolve again to look at it. In the twentifirst sentence I misspell twenty-first with two \"i\"s. In the twenty-second sentence I look down at the list, I have circled no. 18759351 on the list. In the twentisecond sentence I misspell twenty-second using an \"i\" again. In the twenty-third sentence I read what is written next to no. 18759351, it says, \"He was sitting on a bench...,\" but at this moment a breeze enters in through the open window, lifting the page and you begin reading another line, the words, \"And you hand in the application and it takes three months and....\" In the twenty-fourth sentence you can see me set the page down as another person walks through the door. I turn off the electronic typewriter and scroll out the page and place it facedown on the desk and I cover it with a notebook you weren't aware was also there on the desk. Now you can see it, it is almost the exact same color as the surface of the desk and now you can see it. These were the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sentences, respectively, it is the lot of the twenty-seventh sentence to have to announce that. In the twenty-eighth sentence a cloud passes over the apartment on its way into space. In the twenty-ninth sentence, I think, next year this will be the number of my age. The thirtieth sentence is all about the speed at which time is passing. In the thirty-first sentence I won't care anymore, I'll see that reality only accrues to itself and does not have to mean something. In the thirty-second sentence I want you to agree with me. Things happen by chance, and what Montaigne pleads with us to believe, in an essay, is that fortune makes herself known in the act of reading, there is much that I could not have inten@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I wanted to write the story of a metamorphosis. The story is at least partly based on a dream I recall from the diary of another writer. In the dream, which may not be a dream but simply a vision the writer has while seated at his desk, an image of a white horse appears on teh wall. It is a white horse that haunts the writer's mind. The white horse has escaped its traces somewhere on an urban street. It is moving toward the suburbs with an eye to the countryside. It is successful in this movement because it progresses without hurry. It does not gallop. It moves along the street with the gait of a horse that drags a very heavy cart behind it. The horse moves successfully toward its liberation since it does not appear to be a fugitive. My heart beats more quickly when I think about this story, which I have almost certainly partially invented. The horse hides its fear of slaughter. It plays a game. Irony is a kind of secrecy. It is a principle of groups.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Could we think of the act of reading as creative—in the same sense in which we tend to view the act of writing as creative? Could the act of reading even be considered synonymous with writing? In his essay on the death of the author, Roland Barthes describes literature as a “tissue of citations” that refers back to an unknowable number of contexts and referents, rather than a monographic masterpiece, the meaning of which is exhaustively foreseen by a god-like author. The author’s “death,” whether provoked by Barthes’s essay or not, invites a view of literary writing as collaborative. For Barthes, reading and writing cannot be cleanly separated out, cannot be understood as absolutely distinct activities or roles. But we hardly need look as far as 1967 (the date of the first publication of Barthes’s essay, in the American art-world magazine Aspen) to note writing’s dual nature. As our society has become increasingly, and more intently and intensely, mediated online we read and write, write and read, mobilizing packets of data, leaving trails of our locations, activities, preferences, putative selves. We write to read, performing text-based searches, attempting to compose ourselves from contents gleaned from unfathomably capacious databases. Hal Varian, who joined Google as a consultant in 2002, said of the company’s view of human presence on and around its platforms: “Every action a user performs is considered a signal to be analyzed and fed back into the system.” In a digital context, there is no grand difference: distinctions among media types are flattened by code, save for the end user; like writing, in this context reading necessarily produces a “signal,” but not necessarily semantic or symbolic meaning. It is an interesting predicament and also a question of poetics. But to return, again, to the past: long before the internet as we know it existed, back in the days of ARPANET (established in 1969), a poet living on the northern edge of the industrial lower-Manhattan neighborhood lately dubbed “SoHo” with her husband and collaborator, the painter Shūsaku Arakawa, began composing a style of poem deeply invested in a collaborative literary production, concerned with an activated space between poet and reader. Madeline Gins typed—and wrote by hand, and sometimes drew—poems and other experimental scripts that preceded and intervened between her first two books, WORD RAIN (or a Discursive Introduction to the Intimate Philosophical Investigations of G,R,E,T,A, G,A,R,B,O, It Says) (1969) and What the President Will Say and Do!! (1984). She later collected these pages into a folder she, or someone else, labeled “Transformatory Power,” or “Trans-P,” for short. Although this collection was never published, the work is strange and astounding. Gins (1941–2014)—born in the Bronx, raised on Long Island, and subsequently a lifelong New York City resident—is perhaps best known for the speculative architecture firm, Reversible Destiny, that she and Arakawa founded in 1987. Via this organization, the collaborative duo designed and oversaw the realization of structures they believed had the capacity to stave off death, including lofts in Tokyo, a park in Yoro, Japan, and a house in East Hampton. With this work, as well as in various co-authored texts, they attempted to make the case that human acculturation leads to a dulling of the senses and, consequently, human mortality is due to a lack of sensorial stimulation and perceptual challenge.The selection of Gins’s early, previously unpublished poems that follows takes us back to the mid-sixties and seventies, a time before Reversible Destiny. Yet in these writings we see a related concern: through tactics of accumulation and replacement, Gins encourages the reader to discover what words will do once they have been stripped bare of grammar. A list provides structure and a kind of time, without the hierarchies of grammatical sense. Lists are associative and sometimes freeing, playful. They produce a sense of possibility and entailment, a@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This isn’t a great poem. I’m not writing this to write a great poem. I am writing this because I am one person. I am only one. I have a face and a front of my face. I have two shoulders and two hips. I’m living. I live. So what can I do with my face if it can’t see that person’s face? What do I tell my eyes to see? How do I let them know that when they see that face it is that person’s wish that they not know it? How do I tell them we have to go back into the world where no one knows us and we don’t know anyone? How do I tell them to stay there? There is nothing for them to see. How do I tell my hands they will never touch that person’s hands? How do I tell my ears that when that person says my name it is only a word? How do I tell my lips to make that person’s name another word so I can say it? How do I tell my neck that person cannot see it? How do I tell my hair that person cannot pull it? It is my hair. It is my head. How do I tell my teeth they will never strike that person’s teeth? How do I tell my thighs it does not matter what they do? They are the tops of my legs. They will fall apart. How do I tell my back it must never wait for that person? That person will not hold me. That person does not know where I am, does not think of me. Does not know I have exhausted every argument against him. That person does not know I no longer love freedom. That person does not know what it means when I ask for forgiveness. That person does not know I beg the world to let me change. That person cannot see my face. Knows a woman with my name and she is a woman. Does not know the word I hide behind my words. Does not know this face. Does not know this is my face. Says my name and looks at this person. How do I tell my feet to stand here? How do I tell my eyes to see? How do I tell the voice under my voice to keep on speaking? How do I tell my mouth to speak?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I am tired of work; I am tired of building up somebody else’s civilization. Let us take a rest, M’Lissy Jane. I will go down to the Last Chance Saloon, drink a gallon or two of gin, shoot a game or two of dice and sleep the rest of the night on one of Mike’s barrels. You will let the old shanty go to rot, the white people’s clothes turn to dust, and the Calvary Baptist Church sink to the bottomless pit. You will spend your days forgetting you married me and your nights hunting the warm gin Mike serves the ladies in the rear of the Last Chance Saloon. Throw the children into the river; civilization has given us too many. It is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that you are colored. Pluck the stars out of the heavens. The stars mark our destiny. The stars marked my destiny. I am tired of civilization.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Trade, Trade versus Art, Brain, Brain versus Heart; Oh, the earthiness of these hard-hearted times, When clinking dollars, and jingling dimes, Drown all the finer music of the soul. Life as an Octopus with but this creed, That all the world was made to serve his greed; Trade has spread out his mighty myriad claw, And drawn into his foul polluted maw, The brightest and the best, Well nigh, Has he drained dry, The sacred fount of Truth; And if, forsooth, He has left yet some struggling streams from it to go, He has contaminated so their flow, That Truth, scarce is it true. Poor Art with struggling gasp, Lies strangled, dying in his mighty grasp; He locks his grimy fingers ’bout her snowy throat so tender. Is there no power to rescue her, protect, defend her? Shall Art be left to perish? Shall all the images her shrines cherish Be left to this iconoclast, to vulgar Trade? Oh, that mankind had less of Brain and more of Heart, Oh, that the world had less of Trade and more of Art; Then would there be less grinding down the poor, Then would men learn to love each other more; For Trade stalks like a giant through the land, Bearing aloft the rich in his high hand, While down beneath his mighty ponderous tread, He crushes those who cry for daily bread.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
(THE MOB SPEAKS:) See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye! No light is there; none, save the glint that shines In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs Of some wild animal caught in the hunter’s trap. How came this beast in human shape and form? Speak man!—We call you man because you wear His shape—How are you thus? Are you not from That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race Which we have known three centuries? Not from That more than faithful race which through three wars Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!(THE VICTIM SPEAKS:) I am, and am not.(THE MOB SPEAKS AGAIN:) Then who, why are you?(THE VICTIM SPEAKS AGAIN:) I am a thing not new, I am as old As human nature. I am that which lurks, Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed; The ancient trait which fights incessantly Against restraint, balks at the upward climb; The weight forever seeking to obey The law of downward pull—and I am more: The bitter fruit am I of planted seed; The resultant, the inevitable end Of evil forces and the powers of wrong. Lessons in degradation, taught and learned, The memories of cruel sights and deeds, The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate Filtered through fifteen generations have Sprung up and found in me sporadic life. In me the muttered curse of dying men, On me the stain of conquered women, and Consuming me the fearful fires of lust, Lit long ago, by other hands than mine. In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers Of wretches now long dead—their dire bequests. In me the echo of the stifled cry Of children for their battered mothers’ breasts. I claim no race, no race claims me; I am No more than human dregs; degenerate; The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin; I am—just what I am. . . . The race that fed Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same Today. But I—(THE MOB CONCLUDES:) Enough, the brute must die! Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist The fire much longer than this slender pine. Now bring the fuel! Pile it round him! Wait! Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose The agony and terror in his face. And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek! And there’s another! wilder than the first. Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so! Now let it slowly blaze again. See there! He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out, Searching around in vain appeal for help! Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts Down through the coils of chain that hold erect The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree. Stop! to each man no more than one man’s share. You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain, Let us divide its links; this skull, of course, In fair division, to the leader comes. And now his fiendish crime has been avenged; Let us back to our wives and children—say, What did he mean by those last muttered words, “Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we”?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tiny bit of humanity, Blessed with your mother’s face, And cursed with your father’s mind. I say cursed with your father’s mind, Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back, Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot, And looking away, Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond. Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet? Why don’t you kick and howl, And make the neighbors talk about “That damned baby next door,” And make up your mind forthwith To grow up and be a banker Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter Or—?—whatever you decide upon, Rid yourself of these incipient thoughts About being a poet. For poets no longer are makers of songs, Chanters of the gold and purple harvest, Sayers of the glories of earth and sky, Of the sweet pain of love And the keen joy of living; No longer dreamers of the essential dreams, And interpreters of the eternal truth, Through the eternal beauty. Poets these days are unfortunate fellows. Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way Or new things in an old language, They talk abracadabra In an unknown tongue, Each one fashioning for himself A wordy world of shadow problems, And as a self-imagined Atlas, Struggling under it with puny legs and arms, Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load. My son, this is no time nor place for a poet; Grow up and join the big, busy crowd That scrambles for what it thinks it wants Out of this old world which is—as it is— And, probably, always will be. Take the advice of a father who knows: You cannot begin too young Not to be a poet.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The feeling of time derives from heat, an agitation of molecules, oracles from the friction of air through fissures and the leaves of oaks. A few gnats stitch the lake’s edge where a fox turns off the gravel road to nose through rhododendron as children crawl through winter coats to reach a closet’s dark recess. Dawdling at the edge of sleep you work through problems already past though unresolved, a notional path, a crease through heads of wild blue phlox that waking, you can’t follow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We gathered in a field southwest of town, several hundred hauling coolers and folding chairs along a gravel road dry in August, two ruts of soft dust that soaked into our clothes and rose in plumes behind us. By noon we could discern their massive coils emerging from a bale of cloud, scales scattering crescent dapples through walnut fronds, the light polarized, each leaf tip in focus. As their bodies blotted out the sun, the forest faded to silverpoint. A current of cool air extended from the bottomlands an intimation of October, and the bowl of sky deepened its celestial archaeology. Their tails, like banners of a vast army, swept past Orion and his retinue to sighs and scattered applause, the faint wail of a child crying. In half an hour they had passed on in search of deep waters. Before our company dispersed, dust whirling in the wind, we planned to meet again in seven years for the next known migration. Sunlight flashed on windshields and caught along the riverbank a cloudy, keeled scale about the size of a dinner plate, cool as blanc de Chine in the heat of the afternoon.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We pass Bolinas-Stinson School, the fire house, and Smiley's dive; extinguished geodesic domes along the mesa road where Cream Saroyan lives. With a telescope, my sister spies the erstwhile chemist of Argonne who left his post to polish glass. As penance, he engraves a glyph of hydrogen on the blank face of every cliff from Monterey to Inverness. Beside us, cormorants describe the chop in grunts, then plunge through thirty feet of grease. I try to hold my breath as long and cheat or fail. As evening comes we pass the final spit of land. Once more around the Horn and then we'll make for home.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

From the first, I was too reluctant, achieving by dribs and drabs, Happy to linger in shallows while others jackknifed from cliffs, wrong To exact perfection from a sad piece or add notes to a proven tune; But ever the classicist: in swimming lessons, slowest to learn; In fights, tentative, preferring the hammerlock to the jab and hook; cautious In the earliest romances, choking in the clutch, fumbling the caress; or shy Among the crew-cut Cupids bristling at the armory’s weekend dances; But shifty in every game, keeping it close. Always holding still And adjuring others to go slow until we leapt forward that night out of control And pinned to the seats of Tyler Wilson’s outlandishly unstock Ford While, from the opposite side of the valley, scalding in each curve, came the black din And brunt of Sonny Walker’s highjacker Chevrolet, everyone screaming And bearing down to be first across the bridge at Hurricane Creek. Many trophies show us frozen: a leg poised for the hurdle, an arm cocked for the unanswerable spike. What I remember through the windshield’s splintering lens is time, a mailbox Rushing by, the letters TURRENTINE, then darkness rolling inside; Though memory, at best, retrieves maybe six percent in studio light, So even now I think we might have turned: smart with his hands, There is a kind of savior who blusters through the South, good with animals and machines, Who surely somehow would have found a gap, through an open gate Into a marshy cornfield or up a logging road into a hillside wood. At any rate, there is just a little while, shy of any bridge, just as judgment Balances its two blind alternatives and a third accelerates head-on. I’ve made a careful study: things that can only be accomplished in deep space, In another language, in far history, at an almost incalculable speed. Courage is not included, or much foolishness. They spin the purest glass, they split the atom, they speak with God. They make a sort of Teflon hip and attach it with metal screws, Only the threads upbone keep stripping so they have to operate Again and again, and what she’s accomplished is more of a gait, really, Than a walk, so when she moves toward me, across any room, I think too much of my own will implicated in that dragging brace. Each step is obviously trained, and the whole earned motion full Of muscle, plastic, and bone is coordinated by nerves even the Strictest dance does not require. She has said there is no fault, But even in such talk, grace occurs as an accident someone caused. If what I require is a thing too certain, braided from probabilities, There is another thing articulated in the scars that saved her face— And no right now in that night we were shaken and rolled like dice, no right to Say this guilt to be alive is love, or the opposite of lucky is wrong.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Maybe a sin, indecent for sure—dope, The storekeeper called it. Everyone agreed That Manuel Lawrence, who drank Through the side of his mouth, squinting And chortling with pleasure, was hooked; Furthermore, Aunt Brenda, Who was so religious that she made Her daughters bathe with their panties on, Had dubbed it “toy likker, fool thing,” And so might I be, holding the bottle Out to the light, watching it bristle. Watching the slow spume of bubbles Die, I asked myself, could it be alive? When they electrocuted Edwin Dockery, He sat there like a steaming, breathing Bolt, the green muscles in his arms Strained at the chair’s black straps, The little finger of his right hand leapt up, But the charge rose, the four minutes And twenty-five hundred volts of his death, Which in another month will be Thirty-five years old. So the drink fizzed With the promise of mixtures to come. There it was. If the hard-shell Baptists of Alabama are good and content That the monster has died, so am I. I swallowed. Sweet darkness, one thing Led to another, the usual life, waking Sometimes lost, dried blood in the ear, Police gabbling in a strange language. How else would I ever gauge How pleasure might end, walking Past midnight in the vague direction Of music. I am never satisfied.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Down the street, someone must be praying, and though I don’t Go there anymore, I want to at times, to hear the diction And the tone, though the English pronoun for God is obsolete— What goes on is devotion, which wouldn’t change if I heard: The polished sermon, the upright’s arpeggios of vacant notes. What else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts? And those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward To the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who Represents God beams like the white palm of the good hand Of Christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude, Which I am not among, though I feel the abundance of calm And know the beatitude so well I do not have to imagine it, Or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat, Or the ritual linen of Sunday tables that are already set. More than any other days, Sundays stand in unvarying rows That beg attention: there is that studied verisimilitude Of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up For some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom Where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers. That is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed, Aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead But returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep, A desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree. Hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring— I recognized it, waking up, before I weighed the bulk of news Or saw Saturday night’s cars parked randomly along the curb, And though I had no prayer, I wanted to offer something Or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past Must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists On this first and singular day, though I think of it as last.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The tortures of lumbago consumed Aunt Madge, And Leah Vest, once resigned from schoolmarming, Could not be convinced to leave the house, And Mrs. Mary Hogan, after birthing her fifth son, Lay bedfast for the last fifty-two years of her life, Reporting shooting pains that would begin High in her back and shear downward to the feet, As though, she said, she had been glazed in lightning; And also, men, broken on bridges and mills, Shell-shocked veterans, religious alcoholics— Leldon Kilpatrick, Johnson Suggs, Whitey Carlyle: They came and sat there too, leafing through Yellowing Pageants and Progressive Farmers; And, one by one, all entered in and talked While the good doctor gargled a dark chaff In his pipe and took down symptoms, Annotating them on his hidden chart— Numbness, neuralgia, the knotted lymph, The clammy palms—and then he’d scratch His temple’s meaningful patch of white And scrawl out his unfailing barbiturate prescription To be filled by his pharmacist brother-in-law Until half the county had gathered as in a lap— The quantum ache, the mutiny in every house. How much pain, how many diseases Consigned to the mythological, the dropped Ovaries, the torn-up nerves, what women Said, what men wanted to believe? Part of it Laughable, I know. Still I want someone To see, now that they lie safe in graves Beyond the vacant stores, that someone Listened and, hearing the wrong at the heart, Named it something that sounded real, whatever They lived through and died of. I remember Mrs. Lyle who called it a thorn in the flesh, And Mr. Appleton, who had no roof in his mouth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I see the mosquito kneeling on the soft underside of my arm, kneeling Like a fruitpicker, kneeling like an old woman With the proboscis of her prayer buried in the idea of God, And I know we shall not speak with the aliens And that peace will not happen in my life, not unless It is in the burnt oil spreading across the surfaces of ponds, in the dark Egg rafts clotting and the wiggletails expiring like batteries.

In her photographs she is bearded and spurred, embellished five hundred times, Her modular legs crouching, her insufferable head unlocking To lower the razor-edge of its tubes, and she is there in the afternoon When the wind gives up the spirit of cleanliness And there rises from the sound the brackish oyster and squid smell of creation. I lie down in the sleeping bag sodden with rain. Nights with her, I am loved for myself, for the succulent Flange of my upper lip, the twin bellies of my eyelids. She adores the easy, the soft. She picks the tenderest blossoms of insomnia. Mornings while the jackhammer rips the pavement outside my window, While the sanitation workers bang the cans against the big truck and shout to each other over the motor, I watch her strut like an udder with my blood, Imagining the luminous pick descending into Trotsky’s skull and the eleven days I waited for the cold chill, nightmare, and nightsweat of malaria; Imagining the mating call in the vibrations of her wings, And imagining, in the simple knot of her ganglia, How she thrills to my life, how she sings for the harvest.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the first mechanical picker had stripped the field, It left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness That my mother could not console herself to the waste And insisted on having it picked over with human hands, Though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets And the hands had long since gone into the factories. No matter how often my father pointed this out, She worried it the way I’ve worried the extra words In poems that I conceived with the approximate Notion that each stanza should have the same number Of lines and each line the same number of syllables— And disregarded it, telling myself a ripple Or botch on the surface, like the stutter of a speaker, Is all I have to affirm the deep fluency below. The Hebrews distrusted Greek poetry (which embodied Harmony and symmetry, and, therefore, revision) Not for aesthetic reasons, but because they believed That to change the first words, which rose unsmelted From the trance, amounted to sacrilege against God. In countries where, because of the gross abundance Of labor, it’s unlawful to import harvesting machines, I see the women in the fields and think of how, When my mother used to pick, you could tell Her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage That tumbled from her sack so pristinely white And devoid of burrs, it seemed to have already Passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin. Dr. Williams said of Eliot that his poems were so Cautiously wrought that they seemed to come To us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow. What my father loved about my mother was not Just the beauty of her body and face, but the practice Of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands As they made the house that abides in us still As worry and bother, but also the perfect freedom beyond— As cleanliness is next to godliness but is not God.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It was a green barn coat from L. L. Bean That he had ordered, thinking of her Walking the snowy hillside of his dream Though she detested the style and color. That it arrived two days after he died Did not dispose her to detest it less Though she may have wished she did, The way she wished she’d kept house More neatly or baked instead of fried, For every coronary’s a latent homicide— If not what we did, what we did not do. If not what we said, what we did not say. In this, the inner jury’s always out, No different for man or woman— For everyone over forty, the human Condition is grief complicated by guilt. It’s unexceptional really, what’s left After deaths. We’re thrown back on our own taste. That coat, for instance. If that was a gift, She would have to hide to throw it away.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If I ever get over the bodies of women, I am going to think of the rain, of waiting under the eaves of an old house at that moment when it takes a form like fog. It makes the mountain vanish. Then the smell of rain, which is the smell of the earth a plow turns up, only condensed and refined. Almost fifty years since thunder rolled and the nerves woke like secret agents under the skin. Brazil is where I wanted to live. The border is not far from here. Lonely and grateful would be my way to end, and something for the pain please, a little purity to sand the rough edges, a slow downpour from the Dark Ages, a drizzle from the Pleistocene. As I dream of the rain’s long body, I will eliminate from mind all the qualities that rain deletes and then I will be primed to study rain’s power, the first drops lightly hallowing, but now and again a great gallop of the horse of rain or an explosion of orange-green light. A simple radiance, it requires no discipline. Before I knew women, I knew the lonely pleasures of rain. The mist and then the clearing. I will listen where the lightning thrills the rooster up a willow, and my whole life flowing until I have no choice, only the rain, and I step into it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The front seats filled last. Laggards, buffoons, and kiss-ups falling in beside local politicos, the about to be honored, and the hard of hearing. No help from the middle, blenders and criminals. And the back rows: restless, intelligent, unable to commit. My place was always left-center, a little to the rear. The shy sat with me, fearful of discovery. Behind me the dead man’s illegitimate children and the bride’s and groom’s former lovers. There, when lights were lowered, hands plunged under skirts or deftly unzipped flies, and, lights up again, rose and pattered in applause. Ahead, the bored practiced impeccable signatures. But was it a movie or a singing? I remember the whole crowd uplifted, but not the event or the word that brought us together as one— One, I say now, when I had felt myself many, speaking and listening: that was the contradiction.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Gram of mania, animated pepper, shadow-monger dressed in panic, monitor of ghostly footfalls, it concentrates in its essential tic the frog leg dropped into oil and the human shock at the verge. If it would stop and let me look, I might imagine the tropic where it hangs in a hammock between two popsicle sticks admiring the iguana’s stealth, but it does not stop. Hawk- dodger, crow-pretzel, gallows’ twitch. Spider-shark. Porter of readiness, miller of the steady shudder, peripatetic rectitude, run by the power of the sunlit rock, it fortifies Darwin and the idea of being late and the missed appointment. With its blue tail, it reminds us: it will go on. It will not stop.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
On the porch, unbreeched shotgun dangling Across one arm, just after the killing, The murderer, Billy Winkles, made polite Small talk with my father while we waited For the sheriff to come. The reek of cordite Still loomed above the sheeted corpse, his uncle Ben, whose various dark and viscous organs Jeweled the lawn. “Want some coffee, Von?” I heard, and thought, A man is dead. And then: Why had my father brought me there to stand Alone, out of place, half-terrified, bored With the slow yammer of weather and crops? I stepped carefully across the rotted planks Toward an oak where an engine block Depended from a blackened limb and watched A dull dazzle of horseflies, a few puddles Hounds had dug like chocolate ruffles Hemming the chicken yard. “I told the son Of a bitch, come back, I’ll shoot you dead,” And he sure had, for sniffing round his wife. He said, “It just ain’t right.” He rolled A smoke and dragged a steady flame alive While neighbors shyly stomped from pickups And lifted the sheet to poke and peek. “That’s Ben,” one said. “That’s Ben to a T.” But was it? Was any of it real, the empty House, the creek? My father saying, “Now Your mother, she was a Partain, wasn’t she?” “Naw, she was a Winkles, too. My wife was A Partain, she’s over at Mai-Maw’s now.” It went like that, and this. The wind drove Up and set the shirts to popping on the line. A red tricycle leaned above a one-eyed doll. The mountain’s blue escarpment unwound Green bolts of fields, the white shelters Where we lived, all of it somehow wrong, And magical not to have changed while Trucks backed up along the ditch and men With their grown boys clambered uphill To gawk at Uncle Ben who lay like shortcakes Lined up on sawhorses on decoration days. How strange, I thought, that no one prayed, And strange that I was there, actually there, With grown men, not sad or happy, but proud, Knowing even then, the years would mostly Amount to sleep, my father would come back As history, and still there would be To say the strobe of the ambulance light; The sheriff, a tall, portly man, stooping To help the handcuffed killer into the car; And on the grass, bits of liver or spleen— Whatever I’d dream, the world is not a lie.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My grandmother puts her feet in the sink of the bathroom at Sears to wash them in the ritual washing for prayer,wudu, because she has to pray in the store or miss the mandatory prayer time for Muslims She does it with great poise, balancing herself with one plump matronly arm against the automated hot-air hand dryer, after having removed her support knee-highs and laid them aside, folded in thirds, and given me her purse and her packages to hold so she can accomplish this august ritual and get back to the ritual of shopping for housewares Respectable Sears matrons shake their heads and frown as they notice what my grandmother is doing, an affront to American porcelain, a contamination of American Standards by something foreign and unhygienic requiring civic action and possible use of disinfectant spray They fluster about and flutter their hands and I can see a clash of civilizations brewing in the Sears bathroom My grandmother, though she speaks no English, catches their meaning and her look in the mirror says,I have washed my feet over Iznik tile in Istanbul with water from the world's ancient irrigation systems I have washed my feet in the bathhouses of Damascus over painted bowls imported from China among the best families of Aleppo And if you Americans knew anything about civilization and cleanliness, you'd make wider washbins, anyway My grandmother knows one culture—the right one, as do these matrons of the Middle West. For them, my grandmother might as well have been squatting in the mud over a rusty tin in vaguely tropical squalor, Mexican or Middle Eastern, it doesn't matter which, when she lifts her well-groomed foot and puts it over the edge. \"You can't do that,\" one of the women protests, turning to me, \"Tell her she can't do that.\" \"We wash our feet five times a day,\" my grandmother declares hotly in Arabic. \"My feet are cleaner than their sink. Worried about their sink, are they? I should worry about my feet!\" My grandmother nudges me, \"Go on, tell them.\" Standing between the door and the mirror, I can see at multiple angles, my grandmother and the other shoppers, all of them decent and goodhearted women, diligent in cleanliness, grooming, and decorum Even now my grandmother, not to be rushed, is delicately drying her pumps with tissues from her purse For my grandmother always wears well-turned pumps that match her purse, I think in case someone from one of the best families of Aleppo should run into her—here, in front of the Kenmore display I smile at the midwestern women as if my grandmother has just said something lovely about them and shrug at my grandmother as if they had just apologized through me No one is fooled, but I hold the door open for everyone and we all emerge on the sales floor and lose ourselves in the great common ground of housewares on markdown.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 Reverse the book in duration. What does that mean? I am writing to you. These notes now when it’s too late. 2 If the cyborg you read about in bookstores is an immigrant from Mexico crossing into the U.S. beneath a floodlit court, then mine is a Punjabi-British hitchhiker on a JI visa. This is tunneling as seen from a satellite—sort of concave warp in the dirt of the line. 3 She lives in a house with others, including animals, creating individual spaces of companionship and ardor. What happens when this domestic life grows suspect? When the grass reverts in its granular drag to the subject of architecture: the failure of a house to believe in its occupants? 4 Mate with surfaces. Okay. Hitchhike. Okay. Make a cup of Darjeeling tea and start walking down a sidewalk in America. I saw this in a film starring George Clooney; no, Natalie Wood. The last scene is her, the gamine self, kicking off her shoes as the house explodes behind her. Perpetrating, she doesn’t flinch. Sips tea. Keeps walking. I wanted to write that. Continuance. As it related to loss. The secret pleasure of refusing to live like a normal person in a dress/with a sex drive and fingers/dreamy yet stabilized in the café of languages. 5 I want to have sex with what I want to become. This is a statement related to women arriving in a country it would be regressive to leave. Then, writing, I was filled with a longing for—for what? George-in-the-flesh? George Clooney in Idaho, pretending to pick up hitchhikers as research for his next movie in which he plays a mild-mannered serial killer? No. A different series of acts. Tricky. For example, I’m embarrassed by this book. It makes my blood roar to think of you reading it. So intimate. A text. Then it is a document related to shame flooding the body to make it red. Who doesn’t want to heal a human body? Who doesn’t want a perfect human body? The body of my hitchhiker is, thus, inevitably female or Punjabi, fused to the production of secrets. There are no e-mails home from the e-mail café. Nothing. Phone calls, bullshitting. Sickening. I mean, what is this girl/my girl doing, there in a foreign heartland like a dog with a thumb? My Laloo, about to do it. Don’t do it, little one. Red dress. Don’t get into the car. 6 But then, lit up, a red wife, kind of, not really, she sets out to see things as they are. Describes a virtual countryside. Jumps a box car. Drinks domestic beer. Okay. She does it and I write it down: a damaged eye with votive filaments. (I am writing to you.) “No point in writing home.” Then what?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Sex is always monstrous. Blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body. “Please touch me there. More. Oh god.” For a hitchhiker, the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift, itchy, unsafe space on the verge of a New Mexico highway. It is often the sex of another era, in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed. I hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me, ultra-American, like a Christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick. At first, my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian; after all, it is not really hitchhiking to buy a Greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons. Again, this is an example of departure in another time. As a foreign student on scholarship, it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on Salman Rushdie’s early works. Nevertheless: “How can we keep tabs on these JI visa holders, who come over here and . . . the university, as an institution, really needs to be more accountable. We need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information. They need to do their course work and then they need to go home.” I didn’t want to go home. This is a boring sentence. Perhaps for you Oregon is a calming word, evoking images of blackberry pie, ocean vistas, and the capture of suspected felons. I had never heard the word Oregon before. Like the distance of Scotland from London, it seemed impossibly far. A beautiful hazard: to go and keep going. How can I put this? In England, nobody ever, ever, ever did this. I, who once drove straight to Glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar, in a dinged-up Datsun Cherry, was considered an anomaly. “Are you demented? Why do you want to drive in a car to bloody Scotland? It’s seven hours on the M1, man!” Though, outwardly, I was wan and somewhat reticent, I . . . no, I was. My sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in Hyde Park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the London School of Economics that my breasts in that position, from that angle, resembled two fried eggs. We were meeting in a park as per the era. I am sure contemporary Punjabi-British teenagers are fearless individuals, undaunted by the prospect of community censure. Back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench, on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades. It is always a century. In my century, sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like Scotland or Wales and borrowing my father’s car forever. “Are you out of your bleeding head? Your dad’s going to skin you alive!” In some sense, this (driving) is the opposite of hitchhiking, in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar. The day was real in a different way back then, in the way that it sensitized me to risk, a kind of twin to permisson. Two black swans: that day and this one, history and fiction, what I went for and what I really wanted, which I didn’t know until I got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible, considering the trouble I was already in and the rain, which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets; the streetlamps were pink. On Prince Street, in Glasgow, I saw the sign for American style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café. The tables were coated with green plastic. There was hot tea, which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as I focused my eye on a laminated print of a white, blocky rose with a pink dot at its center. “Charles Rennie Mackintosh,” the waitress, pronouncing “osh” so that it rhymed with horse. “Are you from India?” “Would you like some jam with that@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 But I was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer. Exhausted, you lay your head on the kitchen table and said: “But what’s the difference between a monster and a cyborg? I need something to eat. Do you have any chocolate?” Opening the fridge, I said quietly and perhaps too seriously, trying to impress you: “The monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances.” Her fate. Her body. Great Britain. You said: “So, is Laloo English or British?” I said: “She’s from London.” But the more I said London, the more it sounded like a joke. LondonLondonLondon. 2 I was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car. This is something you can only do here. Wish for something. Did you ever do it? Wish you weren’t there? I want that go on, go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the Panama Canal or Idaho. Hitchhiking in Idaho as a veritable child, I was taken in by a farming couple, Fatty and Daddy, a hundred miles or so outside of Boise. Fatty was rail thin, about seventy-five, and Daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife. They picked me up in their truck—I was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers—and I stayed with them for five days. They said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that, and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called Country Buffet. In my innocence, I had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a KKK leader/operative, Charles Reynold. What is an operative? It is someone who is always planning a way in, like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red, bushy tail. Daddy, Fatty, and I hunkered down until Daddy’s nephew, Robert, stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to Boise proper, where there was a bus station. I waited until Robert had gone and then I walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers. “I can take you as far as the state line.” “That would be lovely.” Obsessed, far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at Heathrow Airport or Nestle, the main employers in the dingy part of northwest London that constituted my origins, I said yes. Soft yes to the color green, which is going. 3 That is a tree (going) but also an ocean: a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me; for you it might happen in another place. Mine. Like Laloo, I lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows. Thus, a juniper tree flying by the window, intensely blue, or the Atlantic Ocean, to the left, if the car has a destination to the south, such as to The Keys, is magical to me. Improbable in light of my origins. Hers. The girl in the car. I don’t know. I am writing to you, in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it (the dress, the morning of writing ahead of you) is a café; as if, writing, you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself. For this reason, when I think of you reading, I think of you as writing blindly. You read but you are also writing. As if my own eyes were closed, I see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl. These books are separate from my own work, here in the salt-water notebook, but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense. Like birds. 4 This is pre but the notebook is after. Soaked already at the edge and foamy. Past future. Writing on the warp when dry. Pages. Entries by hand. That is the morning I woke up and walked to the Pacific Ocean, after a night in a motel in Florence, Oregon, complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows. The woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it. An expatriate, she said exaggeratedly, oblivious to our common origin: “About four miles. You’re not going to walk, are you? Do you have an umbrella? You can’t go out like that, ducky.” 5 I walk@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art— Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night And watching, with eternal lids apart, Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priestlike task Of pure ablution round earth's human shores, Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask Of snow upon the mountains and the moors— No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable, Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, And so live ever—or else swoon to death.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

BOOK I A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its loveliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead; All lovely tales that we have heard or read: An endless fountain of immortal drink, Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. Nor do we merely feel these essences For one short hour; no, even as the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, The passion poesy, glories infinite, Haunt us till they become a cheering light Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast; They always must be with us, or we die. Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I Will trace the story of Endymion. The very music of the name has gone Into my being, and each pleasant scene Is growing fresh before me as the green Of our own valleys: so I will begin Now while I cannot hear the city's din; Now while the early budders are just new, And run in mazes of the youngest hue About old forests; while the willow trails Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer My little boat, for many quiet hours, With streams that deepen freshly into bowers. Many and many a verse I hope to write, Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, I must be near the middle of my story. O may no wintry season, bare and hoary, See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold, With universal tinge of sober gold, Be all about me when I make an end. And now, at once adventuresome, I send My herald thought into a wilderness: There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress My uncertain path with green, that I may speed Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was! The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass, And silent was the flock in woolly fold: Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told His rosary, and while his frosted breath, Like pious incense from a censer old, Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith. His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man; Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan, Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees: The sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze, Emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails: Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries, He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails. Northward he turneth through a little door, And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor; But no—already had his deathbell rung; The joys of all his life were said and sung: His was harsh penance on St. Agnes' Eve: Another way he went, and soon among Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve. That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft; And so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide, From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft, The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide: The level chambers, ready with their pride, Were glowing to receive a thousand guests: The carved angels, ever eager-eyed, Star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts. At length burst in the argent revelry, With plume, tiara, and all rich array, Numerous as shadows haunting faerily The brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay Of old romance. These let us wish away, And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there, Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, On love, and wing'd St. Agnes' saintly care, As she had heard old dames full many times declare. They told her how, upon St. Agnes' Eve, Young virgins might have visions of delight, And soft adorings from their loves receive Upon the honey'd middle of the night, If ceremonies due they did aright; As, supperless to bed they must retire, And couch supine their beauties, lily white; Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire. Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline: The music, yearning like a God in pain, She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine, Fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, And back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain, But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year. She danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes, Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: The hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort Of whisperers in anger, or in sport; 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn, And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn. So, purposing each moment to retire, She linger'd still. Meantime, across the moors, Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire For Madeline. Beside the portal doors, Buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores All saints to give him sight of Madeline, But for one moment in the tedious hours, That he might gaze and worship all unseen; Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been. He ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell: All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords Will storm his heart, Love's fev'rous citadel: For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes, Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords, Whose very dogs would execrations howl Against his lineage: not one breast affords Him any mercy, in that mansion foul, Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul. Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came, Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, To where he st@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Ever let the Fancy roam, Pleasure never is at home: At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth, Like to bubbles when rain pelteth; Then let winged Fancy wander Through the thought still spread beyond her: Open wide the mind's cage-door, She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar. O sweet Fancy! let her loose; Summer's joys are spoilt by use, And the enjoying of the Spring Fades as does its blossoming; Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too, Blushing through the mist and dew, Cloys with tasting: What do then? Sit thee by the ingle, when The sear faggot blazes bright, Spirit of a winter's night; When the soundless earth is muffled, And the caked snow is shuffled From the ploughboy's heavy shoon; When the Night doth meet the Noon In a dark conspiracy To banish Even from her sky. Sit thee there, and send abroad, With a mind self-overaw'd, Fancy, high-commission'd:—send her! She has vassals to attend her: She will bring, in spite of frost, Beauties that the earth hath lost; She will bring thee, all together, All delights of summer weather; All the buds and bells of May, From dewy sward or thorny spray; All the heaped Autumn's wealth, With a still, mysterious stealth: She will mix these pleasures up Like three fit wines in a cup, And thou shalt quaff it:—thou shalt hear Distant harvest-carols clear; Rustle of the reaped corn; Sweet birds antheming the morn: And, in the same moment, hark! 'Tis the early April lark, Or the rooks, with busy caw, Foraging for sticks and straw. Thou shalt, at one glance, behold The daisy and the marigold; White-plum'd lillies, and the first Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst; Shaded hyacinth, alway Sapphire queen of the mid-May; And every leaf, and every flower Pearled with the self-same shower. Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep Meagre from its celled sleep; And the snake all winter-thin Cast on sunny bank its skin; Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see Hatching in the hawthorn-tree, When the hen-bird's wing doth rest Quiet on her mossy nest; Then the hurry and alarm When the bee-hive casts its swarm; Acorns ripe down-pattering, While the autumn breezes sing. Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose; Every thing is spoilt by use: Where's the cheek that doth not fade, Too much gaz'd at? Where's the maid Whose lip mature is ever new? Where's the eye, however blue, Doth not weary? Where's the face One would meet in every place? Where's the voice, however soft, One would hear so very oft? At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth Like to bubbles when rain pelteth. Let, then, winged Fancy find Thee a mistress to thy mind: Dulcet-ey'd as Ceres' daughter, Ere the God of Torment taught her How to frown and how to chide; With a waist and with a side White as Hebe's, when her zone Slipt its golden clasp, and down Fell her kirtle to her feet, While she held the goblet sweet And Jove grew languid.—Break the mesh Of the Fancy's silken leash; Quickly break her prison-string And such joys as these she'll bring.— Let the winged Fancy roam, Pleasure never is at home.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Four Seasons fill the measure of the year; There are four seasons in the mind of man:He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear Takes in all beauty with an easy span:He has his Summer, when luxuriously Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he lovesTo ruminate, and by such dreaming high Is nearest unto heaven: quiet covesHis soul has in its Autumn, when his wings He furleth close; contented so to lookOn mists in idleness—to let fair things Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,Or else he would forego his mortal nature.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
BOOK I Deep in the shady sadness of a vale Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star, Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone, Still as the silence round about his lair; Forest on forest hung about his head Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there, Not so much life as on a summer's day Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more By reason of his fallen divinity Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips. Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went, No further than to where his feet had stray'd, And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed; While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet. It seem'd no force could wake him from his place; But there came one, who with a kindred hand Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. She was a Goddess of the infant world; By her in stature the tall Amazon Had stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en Achilles by the hair and bent his neck; Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel. Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx, Pedestal'd haply in a palace court, When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore. But oh! how unlike marble was that face: How beautiful, if sorrow had not made Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self. There was a listening fear in her regard, As if calamity had but begun; As if the vanward clouds of evil days Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear Was with its stored thunder labouring up. One hand she press'd upon that aching spot Where beats the human heart, as if just there, Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain: The other upon Saturn's bended neck She laid, and to the level of his ear Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake In solemn tenour and deep organ tone: Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue Would come in these like accents; O how frail To that large utterance of the early Gods! \"Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King? I have no comfort for thee, no not one: I cannot say, \"O wherefore sleepest thou?\" For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God; And ocean too, with all its solemn noise, Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air Is emptied of thine hoary majesty. Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; And thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands Scorches and burns our once serene domain. O aching time! O moments big as years! All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, And press it so upon our weary griefs That unbelief has not a space to breathe. Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude? Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes? Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\" As when, upon a tranced summer-night, Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, Save from one gradual solitary gust Which comes upon the silence, and dies off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave; So came these words and went; the while in tears She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, Just where her falling hair might be outspread A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet. One moon, with alteration slow, had shed Her silver seasons four upon the night, And still these two were postured motionless, Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; The frozen God still couchant on the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet: Until at length old Saturn lifted up His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake, As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard Shook horrid with such aspen-malady: \"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion, Thea, I feel thee ere I s@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest Of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine, That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast, Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all, Withhold no atom’s atom or I die Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall, Forget, in the mist of idle misery, Life’s purposes,—the palate of my mind Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I see a lily on thy brow, With anguish moist and fever-dew, And on thy cheeks a fading rose Fast withereth too. I met a lady in the meadsmeads Meadow , Full beautiful—a faery’s child, Her hair was long, her foot was light, And her eyes were wild. I made a garland for her head, And bracelets too, and fragrant zone; She looked at me as she did love, And made sweet moanmade sweet moan Compare \"virgin-choir to make delicious moan\" from Ode to Psyche (30), written between April 21 and 30, 1819. Noted by John Barnard in John Keats: The Complete Poems (Penguin, 2003). I set her on my pacing steed, And nothing else saw all day long, For sidelong would she bend, and sing A faery’s song. She found me roots of relish sweet, And honey wild, and manna-dewhoney wild, and manna-dew Echoes manna in the Bible, first described in Exodus, 16:14-21, 31. The Israelites eat the manna, a food miraculously supplied in the wilderness after the dew has lifted, in the morning: “The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey” (Exodus 16:31, NRSV)., And sure in language strange she said— ‘I love thee true’. She took me to her Elfin grotElfin grot An elf’s grotto , And there she wept and sighed full sore, And there I shut her wild wild eyes With kisses four. And there she lullèd me asleep, And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!— The latest dream I ever dreamt On the cold hill side. I saw pale kings and princes too, Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans MerciLa Belle Dame sans Merci This phrase—and the poem’s title—is from Alain Chartier’s courtly French ballad, “La Belle Dame sans Merci” (1424). Keats wrote the poem in a letter to George and Georgiana Keats, April 21, 1819. Thee hathThee hath The version of this poem has “Thee hath” (see The Letters of John Keats, 1814-1821, ed. H. E. Rollins, 1958); though other versions of this poem reads “Hath thee” in thrall!’ I saw their starved lips in the gloamgloam Twilight; Keats coined the word from “gloaming”, With horrid warning gapèd wide, And I awoke and found me here, On the cold hill’s side. And this is why I sojournsojourn To stay or visit temporarily here, Alone and palely loitering, Though the sedge is withered from the lake, And no birds sing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Old Meg she was a Gipsy, And liv'd upon the Moors: Her bed it was the brown heath turf, And her house was out of doors. Her apples were swart blackberries, Her currants pods o' broom; Her wine was dew of the wild white rose, Her book a churchyard tomb. Her Brothers were the craggy hills, Her Sisters larchen trees— Alone with her great family She liv'd as she did please. No breakfast had she many a morn, No dinner many a noon, And 'stead of supper she would stare Full hard against the Moon. But every morn of woodbine fresh She made her garlanding, And every night the dark glen Yew She wove, and she would sing. And with her fingers old and brown She plaited Mats o' Rushes, And gave them to the Cottagers She met among the Bushes. Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon: An old red blanket cloak she wore; A chip hat had she on. God rest her aged bones somewhere— She died full long agone!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
And what is love? It is a doll dress’d up For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle; A thing of soft misnomers, so divine That silly youth doth think to make itself Divine by loving, and so goes on Yawning and doting a whole summer long, Till Miss’s comb is made a pearl tiara, And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots; Then Cleopatra lives at number seven, And Antony resides in Brunswick Square. Fools! if some passions high have warm’d the world, If Queens and Soldiers have play’d deep for hearts, It is no reason why such agonies Should be more common than the growth of weeds. Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl The Queen of Egypt melted, and I’ll say That ye may love in spite of beaver hats.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, Thou foster-child of silence and slow time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme: What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare; Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu; And, happy melodist, unwearied, For ever piping songs for ever new; More happy love! more happy, happy love! For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd, For ever panting, and for ever young; All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue. Who are these coming to the sacrifice? To what green altar, O mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken flanks with garlands drest? What little town by river or sea shore, Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn? And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede Of marble men and maidens overwrought, With forest branches and the trodden weed; Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral! When old age shall this generation waste, Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One morn before me were three figures seen, With bowèd necks, and joinèd hands, side-faced; And one behind the other stepp’d serene, In placid sandals, and in white robes graced; They pass’d, like figures on a marble urn, When shifted round to see the other side; They came again; as when the urn once more Is shifted round, the first seen shades return; And they were strange to me, as may betide With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not? How came ye muffled in so hush a mask? Was it a silent deep-disguisèd plot To steal away, and leave without a task My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour; The blissful cloud of summer-indolence Benumb’d my eyes; my pulse grew less and less; Pain had no sting, and pleasure’s wreath no flower: O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense Unhaunted quite of all but—nothingness?A third time pass’d they by, and, passing, turn’d Each one the face a moment whiles to me; Then faded, and to follow them I burn’d And ached for wings, because I knew the three; The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name; The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, And ever watchful with fatiguèd eye; The last, whom I love more, the more of blame Is heap’d upon her, maiden most unmeek,— I knew to be my demon Poesy.They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings: O folly! What is Love? and where is it? And for that poor Ambition! it springs From a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit; For Poesy!—no,—she has not a joy,— At least for me,—so sweet as drowsy noons, And evenings steep’d in honey’d indolence; O, for an age so shelter’d from annoy, That I may never know how change the moons, Or hear the voice of busy common-sense! And once more came they by:—alas! wherefore? My sleep had been embroider’d with dim dreams; My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, Tho’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; The open casement press’d a new-leaved vine, Let in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay; O Shadows! ’twas a time to bid farewell! Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; For I would not be dieted with praise, A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce! Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; Farewell! I yet have visions for the night, And for the day faint visions there is store; Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright, Into the clouds, and never more return!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine; Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine; Make not your rosary of yew-berries, Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl A partner in your sorrow's mysteries; For shade to shade will come too drowsily, And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul. But when the melancholy fit shall fall Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud, That fosters the droop-headed flowers all, And hides the green hill in an April shroud; Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose, Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, Or on the wealth of globed peonies; Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows, Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave, And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes. She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die; And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh, Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips: Ay, in the very temple of Delight Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine, Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine; His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might, And be among her cloudy trophies hung.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness,— That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees In some melodious plot Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease. O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, Tasting of Flora and the country green, Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth! O for a beaker full of the warm South, Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, And purple-stained mouth; That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim: Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget What thou among the leaves hast never known, The weariness, the fever, and the fret Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despairs, Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, But on the viewless wings of Poesy, Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: Already with thee! tender is the night, And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays; But here there is no light, Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet Wherewith the seasonable month endows The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; And mid-May's eldest child, The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death, Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, To take into the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die, To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstasy! Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— To thy high requiem become a sod. Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! No hungry generations tread thee down; The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days by emperor and clown: Perhaps the self-same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn; The same that oft-times hath Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. Forlorn! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self! Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf. Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades: Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
O Goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear, And pardon that thy secrets should be sung Even into thine own soft-conched ear: Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes? I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise, Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran A brooklet, scarce espied: Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian, They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass; Their arms embraced, and their pinions too; Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu, As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, And ready still past kisses to outnumber At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love: The winged boy I knew; But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove? His Psyche true! O latest born and loveliest vision far Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy! Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region'd star, Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none, Nor altar heap'd with flowers; Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan Upon the midnight hours; No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet From chain-swung censer teeming; No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming. O brightest! though too late for antique vows, Too, too late for the fond believing lyre, When holy were the haunted forest boughs, Holy the air, the water, and the fire; Yet even in these days so far retir'd From happy pieties, thy lucent fans, Fluttering among the faint Olympians, I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd. So let me be thy choir, and make a moan Upon the midnight hours; Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet From swinged censer teeming; Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming. Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane In some untrodden region of my mind, Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees, The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep; And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I dress With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, With buds, and bells, and stars without a name, With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign, Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: And there shall be for thee all soft delight That shadowy thought can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, To let the warm Love in!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
As Hermes once took to his feathers light, When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon’d and slept, So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright So play’d, so charm’d, so conquer’d, so bereft The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes; And seeing it asleep, so fled away, Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies, Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev’d that day; But to that second circle of sad Hell, Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell Their sorrows—pale were the sweet lips I saw, Pale were the lips I kiss’d, and fair the form I floated with, about that melancholy storm.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold, And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; Round many western islands have I been Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold. Oft of one wide expanse had I been told That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne; Yet did I never breathe its pure serene Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold: Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men Look'd at each other with a wild surmise— Silent, upon a peak in Darien.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My spirit is too weak—mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, And each imagined pinnacle and steep Of godlike hardship tells me I must die Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. Yet ’tis a gentle luxury to weep That I have not the cloudy winds to keep Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye. Such dim-conceived glories of the brain Bring round the heart an undescribable feud; So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude Wasting of old time—with a billowy main— A sun—a shadow of a magnitude.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute! Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away! Leave melodizing on this wintry day, Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute: Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute, Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay Must I burn through; once more humbly assay The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit. Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion, Begetters of our deep eternal theme, When through the old oak forest I am gone, Let me not wander in a barren dream, But when I am consumed in the fire, Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The Poetry of earth is never dead: When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead; That is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead In summer luxury,—he has never done With his delights; for when tired out with fun He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. The poetry of earth is ceasing never: On a lone winter evening, when the frost Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever, And seems to one in drowsiness half lost, The Grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
No! those days are gone away And their hours are old and gray, And their minutes buried all Under the down-trodden pall Of the leaves of many years: Many times have winter's shears, Frozen North, and chilling East, Sounded tempests to the feast Of the forest's whispering fleeces, Since men knew nor rent nor leases. No, the bugle sounds no more, And the twanging bow no more; Silent is the ivory shrill Past the heath and up the hill; There is no mid-forest laugh, Where lone Echo gives the half To some wight, amaz'd to hear Jesting, deep in forest drear. On the fairest time of June You may go, with sun or moon, Or the seven stars to light you, Or the polar ray to right you; But you never may behold Little John, or Robin bold; Never one, of all the clan, Thrumming on an empty can Some old hunting ditty, while He doth his green way beguile To fair hostess Merriment, Down beside the pasture Trent; For he left the merry tale Messenger for spicy ale. Gone, the merry morris din; Gone, the song of Gamelyn; Gone, the tough-belted outlaw Idling in the \"grenè shawe\"; All are gone away and past! And if Robin should be cast Sudden from his turfed grave, And if Marian should have Once again her forest days, She would weep, and he would craze: He would swear, for all his oaks, Fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes, Have rotted on the briny seas; She would weep that her wild bees Sang not to her—strange! that honey Can't be got without hard money! So it is: yet let us sing, Honour to the old bow-string! Honour to the bugle-horn! Honour to the woods unshorn! Honour to the Lincoln green! Honour to the archer keen! Honour to tight little John, And the horse he rode upon! Honour to bold Robin Hood, Sleeping in the underwood! Honour to maid Marian, And to all the Sherwood-clan! Though their days have hurried by Let us two a burden try.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I am no knight whose foeman dies; No cuirass glistens on my bosom’s swell; I am no happy shepherd of the dell Whose lips have trembled with a maiden’s eyes. Yet must I dote upon thee—call thee sweet, Sweeter by far than Hybla’s honied roses When steep’d in dew rich to intoxication. Ah! I will taste that dew, for me ‘tis meet, And when the moon her pallid face discloses, I’ll gather some by spells, and incantation.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; ConspiringConspiring Working together; literally, to conspire is “to breathe together” (OED) with him how to load and bless With fruit the vines that round the thatch-evesthatch-eves Thatch-eaves, the edge of thatched roofs run; To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel; to set budding more, And still more, later flowers for the bees, Until they think warm days will never cease, For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells. Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowingwinnowing Separating the wheat from the chaff, the heavy from the light wind; Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep, Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hookhook Scythe Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers: And sometimes like a gleanergleaner One who gathers the remaining food after the reaper has harvested the field thou dost keep Steady thy ladenladen Loaded down head across a brook; Or by a cyder-press, with patient look, Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours. Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?Where are they? Rhetorical convention known as ubi sunt, often appearing in poems that meditate on the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death. Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,— While barred clouds bloombloom “to colour with a soft warm tint or glow” (OED) the soft-dying day, And touch the stubble-plainsstubble-plains Fields made up of stubble, the remaining stumps of grain left after reaping with rosy hue; Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallowssallows Willow trees, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies; And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn; Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft The red-breast whistles from a garden-croftgarden-croft A croft is a small enclosed field; And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I cry your mercy—pity—love! Aye, love! Merciful love that tantalizes not, One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love, Unmasked, and being seen—without a blot! O! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine! That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest Of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine, That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,— Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all, Withhold no atom’s atom or I die, Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall, Forget, in the mist of idle misery, Life’s purposes,—the palate of my mind Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Standing aloof in giant ignorance, Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades, As one who sits ashore and longs perchance To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas. So thou wast blind;—but then the veil was rent, For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live, And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent, And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive; Aye on the shores of darkness there is light, And precipices show untrodden green, There is a budding morrow in midnight, There is a triple sight in blindness keen; Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
To one who has been long in city pent, 'Tis very sweet to look into the fair And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer Full in the smile of the blue firmament. Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair And gentle tale of love and languishment? Returning home at evening, with an ear Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, He mourns that day so soon has glided by: E'en like the passage of an angel's tear That falls through the clear ether silently.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
O soft embalmer of the still midnight, Shutting, with careful fingers and benign,Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light, Enshaded in forgetfulness divine:O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,Or wait the \"Amen,\" ere thy poppy throws Around my bed its lulling charities.Then save me, or the passed day will shineUpon my pillow, breeding many woes,— Save me from curious Conscience, that still lordsIts strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole; Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I have fears that I may cease to be Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, Before high-pilèd books, in charactery, Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain; When I behold, upon the night’s starred face, Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace Their shadows with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, That I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the faery power Of unreflecting love—then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Last night whistling I passed by their alley, saw them in a sidelong blink of light from traffic, a speeding car, then I went home. Dreamed of gold skies, black money. I felt so stupid, to talk about them feels stupid. I’m the sullen red Sun. Bernadette leans from tenement windows, sailors keep searching world after world for Bernadette, and her arms are black, her outstretched proffered palms all milky. From them coins drop into Pickpocket’s pockets freely. Pickpocket’s face is pocked, his arms are pocked. I threw his face in a lake to make it ripple, he smokes a cigar to an orange hot hole in his face, a glow. At night the Sun’s a kid brought behind the woodshed and abased.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

tend their yard every weekend, when they paint or straighten the purple fencepickets canting each other at the edge of their lot, hammering them down into soil to stand. How long will they stay put? My neighbors mend their gate, hinges rusted to blood-colored dust, then weave gold party-lights with orange lobster-nets & blue buoys along the planks. So much to see & not see again, each chore undone before they know it. I love how faithfully they work their garden all year, scumbling dried eelgrass in fall, raking away mulch in spring. Today the older one, Pat, plants weeds ripped from a cranberry-bog. Sassafras & pickerel, black locust & meadowsweet, wild sarsaparilla, checkerberry, starflower. Will they take root here? Meanwhile Chris waters seeds sown months ago. Furrows of kale, snap-bean, scallion break the surface, greedy for life. Muskrose & lilac cast their last shadows. Is it seeing or sun that makes them flicker, as if they’ve vanished? They shake like a letter in someone’s hand. Here come the guys from Whorfs (“Whores”) Court, walking their dog —also in drag—to the dunes. I miss seeing Disorient Express (a.k.a. Cheng, out of drag) walk by, in tulle & sequins the exact shade of bok choi. He must have endured things no one can name, to name only KS, pneumocystis, aplastic anemia. I remember he walked off his gurney when the ambulance came, then broke his nurse’s fingers in the hospital when he tried to change his IV line, wanting to live without meds. Zorivax, Ativan, leucovorin? I don't know. Pat & Chris pack down the loose dirt. I’ll never know what threads hold our lives together. They kiss, then fall on the grass. I should look away but don’t.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
None of the streets here has a name, but if I’m lost tonight I’m happy to be lost. Ten million lanterns light the Seoul avenues for Buddha’s Birthday, ten million red blue green silver gold moons burning far as the eye can see in every direction & beyond, “one for every spirit,” voltage sizzling socket to socket as thought does, firing & firing the soul. Lashed by wind, flying up like helium balloons or hanging still depending on weather, they turn each road into an earthly River of Heaven doubling & reversing the river above, though not made of much: some colored paper, glue, a few wires, a constellation of poor facts. I can't help feeling giddy. I'm drunk on neon, drunk on air, drunk on seeing what was made almost from nothing: if anything's here at all it was built out of ash, out of the skull-rubble of war, the city rising brick by brick like a shared dream, every bridge & pylon & girder & spar a miracle, when half a century ago there was nothing but shrapnel, broken mortar-casings, corpses, the War Memorial in Itaewon counting More than 3 Million Dead, or Missing— still missed by the living, still loved beyond reason, monument to the fact that no one can hurt you, no one kill you like your own people. I’ll never understand it. I wonder about others I see on the sidewalks, each soul fathomless— strikers & scabs walking through Kwanghwamoon, or “Gate of Transformation by Light,” riot police rapping nightsticks against plexiglass-shields, hawkers haggling over cell phones or silk shirts, shaking dirt from chamae & bok choi, chanting price after price, fishermen cleaning tubs of cuttlefish & squid, stripping copper carp, lifting eels or green turtles dripping from tanks, Hanyak peddlars calling out names of cures for sickness or love—crushed bees, snake bile, ground deer antler, chrysanthemum root, bus drivers hurtling past in a blast of diesel-fumes, lovers so tender with each other I hold my breath, dispatchers shouting the names of stations, the grocer who calls me “daughter” because I look like her, for she has long since left home, vendors setting up pojangmachas to cook charred silkworms, broiled sparrows, frying sesame-leaves & mung-bean pancakes, men with hair the color of scallion root playing paduk, or GO, old enough to have stolen overcoats & shoes from corpses, whose spirits could not be broken, whose every breath seems to say: after things turned to their worst, we began again, but may you never go through what we went through, may you never see what we saw, may you never remember & may you never forget.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the village it’s the season of dried grass,the smell of burned dirt,gaslight glinting through blackened stubble.I walk home across the rice-fields,brushing insects away from my face,remembering old Namdong who was buried yesterday.What does death ask of us?I must change whatever it was I waswhen the old man was alive.I keep looking at the rice-fields, glinting in the dark.Blasted by mildew, more withered than last year —how much work and love it must have taken.In autumn, no matter how bad the harvest,how big the debts —no thought of leaving here, no thought of rest.As life goes on, time isn’t the largest thing to think of,it’s the smallest.Growing, goingin drought or monsoon, mold or blight —what is the rice if not alive?With Sunja Kim Kwock@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If the angle of an eye is all, the slant of hope, the slant of dreaming, according to each life, what is the light of this city, light of Lady Liberty, possessor of the most famous armpit in the world, light of the lovers on Chinese soap operas, throwing BBQ’d ducks at each other with that live-it-up-while-you’re-young, Woo Me kind of love, light of the old men sitting on crates outside geegaw shops selling dried seahorses & plastic Temples of Heaven, light of the Ying ‘n’ Yang Junk Palace, light of the Golden Phoenix Hair Salon, light of Wig-o-ramas, light of the suntanners in Central Park turning over like rotisserie chickens sizzling on a spit, light of the Pluck U & Gone with the Wings fried-chicken shops, the parking-meter-leaners, the Glamazons, the oglers wearing fern-wilting quantities of cologne, strutting, trash-talking, glorious: the immigrants, the refugees, the peddlars, stockbrokers and janitors, stenographers and cooks, all of us making and unmaking ourselves, hurrying forwards, toward who we’ll become, one way only, one life only: free in time but not from it, here in the city the living make together, and make and unmake over and over Quick, quick, ask heaven of it, of every mortal relation, feeling that is fleeing, for what would the heart be without a heaven to set it on?

For I can snore like a bullhorn or play loud music or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman and Fergus will only sink deeper into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash, but let there be that heavy breathing or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house and he will wrench himself awake and make for it on the run—as now, we lie together, after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies, familiar touch of the long-married, and he appears—in his baseball pajamas, it happens, the neck opening so small he has to screw them on— and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child. In the half darkness we look at each other and smile and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body— this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making, sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake, this blessing love gives again into our arms.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 In the evening haze darkening on the hills, purple of the eternal, a last bird crosses over, ‘flop flop,’ adoring only the instant. 2 Nine years ago, in a plane that rumbled all night above the Atlantic, I could see, lit up by lightning bolts jumping out of it, a thunderhead formed like the face of my brother, looking down on blue, lightning-flashed moments of the Atlantic. 3 He used to tell me, “What good is the day? On some hill of despair the bonfire you kindle can light the great sky— though it’s true, of course, to make it burn you have to throw yourself in ...” 4 Wind tears itself hollow in the eaves of these ruins, ghost-flute of snowdrifts that build out there in the dark: upside-down ravines into which night sweeps our cast wings, our ink-spattered feathers. 5 I listen. I hear nothing. Only the cow, the cow of such hollowness, mooing down the bones. 6 Is that a rooster? He thrashes in the snow for a grain. Finds it. Rips it into flames. Flaps. Crows. Flames bursting out of his brow. 7 How many nights must it take one such as me to learn that we aren’t, after all, made from that bird that flies out of its ashes, that for us as we go up in flames, our one work is to open ourselves, to be the flames?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 In late winter I sometimes glimpse bits of steam coming up from some fault in the old snow and bend close and see it is lung-colored and put down my nose and know the chilly, enduring odor of bear. 2 I take a wolf’s rib and whittle it sharp at both ends and coil it up and freeze it in blubber and place it out on the fairway of the bears. And when it has vanished I move out on the bear tracks, roaming in circles until I come to the first, tentative, dark splash on the earth. And I set out running, following the splashes of blood wandering over the world. At the cut, gashed resting places I stop and rest, at the crawl-marks where he lay out on his belly to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice I lie out dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists. 3 On the third day I begin to starve, at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would at a turd sopped in blood, and hesitate, and pick it up, and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down, and rise and go on running. 4 On the seventh day, living by now on bear blood alone, I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled, steamy hulk, the heavy fur riffling in the wind. I come up to him and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes, the dismayed face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils flared, catching perhaps the first taint of me as he died. I hack a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink, and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up after me, against the wind, and sleep. 5 And dream of lumbering flatfooted over the tundra, stabbed twice from within, splattering a trail behind me, splattering it out no matter which way I lurch, no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence, which dance of solitude I attempt, which gravity-clutched leap, which trudge, which groan. 6 Until one day I totter and fall— fall on this stomach that has tried so hard to keep up, to digest the blood as it leaked in, to break up and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze blows over me, blows off the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood and rotted stomach and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear, blows across my sore, lolled tongue a song or screech, until I think I must rise up and dance. And I lie still. 7 I awaken I think. Marshlights reappear, geese come trailing again up the flyway. In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear lies, licking lumps of smeared fur and drizzly eyes into shapes with her tongue. And one hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me, the next groaned out, the next, the next, the rest of my days I spend wandering: wondering what, anyway, was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood, that poetry, by which I lived?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He lives, who last night flopped from a log Into the creek, and all night by an ankle Lay pinned to the flood, dead as a nail But for the skin of the teeth of his dog. I brought him boiled eggs and broth. He coughed and waved his spoon And sat up saying he would dine alone, Being fatigue itself after that bath. I sat without in the sun with the dog. Wearing a stocking on the ailing foot, In monster crutches, he hobbled out, And addressed the dog in bitter rage. He told the yellow hound, his rescuer, Its heart was bad, and it ought Not wander by the creek at night; If all his dogs got drowned he would be poor. He stroked its head and disappeared in the shed And came out with a stone mallet in his hands And lifted that rocky weight of many pounds And let it lapse on top of the dog's head. I carted off the carcass, dug it deep. Then he came too with what a thing to lug, Or pour on a dog’s grave, his thundermug, And poured it out and went indoors to sleep. I saw him sleepless in the pane of glass Looking wild-eyed at sunset, then the glare Blinded the glass—only a red square Burning a house burning in the wilderness.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Goodbye, lady in Bangor, who sent me snapshots of yourself, after definitely hinting you were beautiful; goodbye, Miami Beach urologist, who enclosed plain brown envelopes for the return of your very “Clinical Sonnets”; goodbye, manufacturer of brassieres on the Coast, whose eclogues give the fullest treatment in literature yet to the sagging breast motif; goodbye, you in San Quentin, who wrote, “Being German my hero is Hitler,” instead of “Sincerely yours,” at the end of long, neat-scripted letters extolling the Pre-Raphaelites: I swear to you, it was just my way of cheering myself up, as I licked the stamped, self-addressed envelopes, the game I had of trying to guess which one of you, this time, had poisoned his glue. I did care. I did read each poem entire. I did say everything I thought in the mildest words I knew. And now, in this poem, or chopped prose, no better, I realize, than those troubled lines I kept sending back to you, I have to say I am relieved it is over: at the end I could feel only pity for that urge toward more life your poems kept smothering in words, the smell of which, days later, tingled in your nostrils as new, God-given impulses to write. Goodbye, you who are, for me, the postmarks again of imaginary towns—Xenia, Burnt Cabins, Hornell— their solitude given away in poems, only their loneliness kept.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 I can support it no longer. Laughing ruefully at myself For all I claim to have suffered I get up. Damned nightmarer! It is New Hampshire out here, It is nearly the dawn. The song of the whippoorwill stops And the dimension of depth seizes everything. 2 The whistles of a peabody bird go overhead Like a needle pushed five times through the air, They enter the leaves, and come out little changed. The air is so still That as they go off through the trees The love songs of birds do not get any fainter. 3 The last memory I have Is of a flower that cannot be touched, Through the bloom of which, all day, Fly crazed, missing bees. 4 As I climb sweat gets up my nostrils, For an instant I think I am at the sea, One summer off Cap Ferrat we watched a black seagull Straining for the dawn, we stood in the surf, Grasshoppers splash up where I step, The mountain laurel crashes at my thighs. 5 There is something joyous in the elegies Of birds. They seem Caught up in a formal delight, Though the mourning dove whistles of despair. But at last in the thousand elegies The dead rise in our hearts, On the brink of our happiness we stop Like someone on a drunk starting to weep. 6 I kneel at a pool, I look through my face At the bacteria I think I see crawling through the moss. My face sees me, The water stirs, the face, Looking preoccupied, Gets knocked from its bones. 7 I weighed eleven pounds At birth, having stayed on Two extra weeks in the womb. Tempted by room and fresh air I came out big as a policeman Blue-faced, with narrow red eyes. It was eight days before the doctor Would scare my mother with me. Turning and craning in the vines I can make out through the leaves The old, shimmering nothingness, the sky. 8 Green, scaly moosewoods ascend, Tenants of the shaken paradise, At every wind last night’s rain Comes splattering from the leaves, It drops in flurries and lies there, The footsteps of some running start. 9 From a rock A waterfall, A single trickle like a strand of wire, Breaks into beads halfway down. I know The birds fly off But the hug of the earth wraps With moss their graves and the giant boulders. 10 In the forest I discover a flower. The invisible life of the thing Goes up in flames that are invisible, Like cellophane burning in the sunlight. It burns up. Its drift is to be nothing. In its covertness it has a way Of uttering itself in place of itself, Its blossoms claim to float in the Empyrean, A wrathful presence on the blur of the ground. The appeal to heaven breaks off. The petals begin to fall, in self-forgiveness. It is a flower. On this mountainside it is dying.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The man splitting wood in the daybreak looks strong, as though, if one weakened, one could turn to him and he would help. Gus Newland was strong. When he split wood he struck hard, flashing the bright steel through the air so hard the hard maple leapt apart, as it’s feared marriages will do in countries reluctant to permit divorce, and even willow, which, though stacked to dry a full year, on being split actually weeps—totem wood, therefore, to the married-until-death—sunders with many little lip-wetting gasp-noises. But Gus is dead. We could turn to our fathers, but they help us only by the unperplexed looking-back of the numerals cut into headstones. Or to our mothers, whose love, so devastated, can’t, even in spring, break through the hard earth. Our spouses weaken at the same rate we do. We have to hold our children up to lean on them. Everyone who could help goes or hasn’t arrived. What about the man splitting wood in the daybreak, who looked strong? That was years ago. That was me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
While spoon-feeding him with one hand she holds his hand with her other hand, or rather lets it rest on top of his, which is permanently clenched shut. When he turns his head away, she reaches around and puts in the spoonful blind. He will not accept the next morsel until he has completely chewed this one. His bright squint tells her he finds the shrimp she has just put in delicious. Next to the voice and touch of those we love, food may be our last pleasure on earth— a man on death row takes his T-bone in small bites and swishes each sip of the jug wine around in his mouth, tomorrow will be too late for them to jolt this supper out of him. She strokes his head very slowly, as if to cheer up each separate discomfited hair sticking up from its root in his stricken brain. Standing behind him, she presses her cheek to his, kisses his jowl, and his eyes seem to stop seeing and do nothing but emit light. Could heaven be a time, after we are dead, of remembering the knowledge flesh had from flesh? The flesh of his face is hard, perhaps from years spent facing down others until they fell back, and harder from years of being himself faced down and falling back in his turn, and harder still from all the while frowning and beaming and worrying and shouting and probably letting go in rages. His face softens into a kind of quizzical wince, as if one of the other animals were working at getting the knack of the human smile. When picking up a cookie he uses both thumbtips to grip it and push it against an index finger to secure it so that he can lift it. She takes him then to the bathroom, where she lowers his pants and removes the wet diaper and holds the spout of the bottle to his old penis until he pisses all he can, then puts on the fresh diaper and pulls up his pants. When they come out, she is facing him, walking backwards in front of him and holding his hands, pulling him when he stops, reminding him to step when he forgets and starts to pitch forward. She is leading her old father into the future as far as they can go, and she is walking him back into her childhood, where she stood in bare feet on the toes of his shoes and they foxtrotted on this same rug. I watch them closely: she could be teaching him the last steps that one day she may teach me. At this moment, he glints and shines, as if it will be only a small dislocation for him to pass from this paradise into the next.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I can feel she has got out of bed. That means it is seven a.m. I have been lying with eyes shut, thinking, or possibly dreaming, of how she might look if, at breakfast, I spoke about the hidden place in her which, to me, is like a soprano’s tremolo, and right then, over toast and bramble jelly, if such things are possible, she came. I imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it. I imagine her hair would fall about her face and she would become apparently downcast, as she does at a concert when she is moved. The hypnopompic play passes, and I open my eyes and there she is, next to the bed, bending to a low drawer, picking over various small smooth black, white, and pink items of underwear. She bends so low her back runs parallel to the earth, but there is no sway in it, there is little burden, the day has hardly begun. The two mounds of muscles for walking, leaping, lovemaking, lift toward the east—what can I say? Simile is useless; there is nothing like them on earth. Her breasts fall full; the nipples are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars of the gate under the earth where those who could not love press, wanting to be born again. I reach out and take her wrist and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas. Later, when I open my eyes, there she is again, rummaging in the same low drawer. The clock shows eight. Hmmm. With huge, silent effort of great, mounded muscles the earth has been turning. She takes a piece of silken cloth from the drawer and stands up. Under the falls of hair her face has become quiet and downcast, as if she will be, all day among strangers, looking down inside herself at our rapture.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The bud stands for all things, even for those things that don’t flower, for everything flowers, from within, of self-blessing; though sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness, to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch it is lovely until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing; as Saint Francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow, and told her in words and in touch blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow began remembering all down her thick length, from the earthen snout all the way through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail, from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them: the long, perfect loveliness of sow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When first I walked here I hobbled along ties set too close together for a boy to step easily on each. I thought my stride one day would reach every other and from then on I would walk in time with the way toward that Lobachevskian haze up ahead where the two rails meet. Here we put down our pennies, dark, on shined steel; they trembled, fell still; then the locomotive out of Attleboro rattling its berserk wheel-rods into perfect circles, brightened them into wafers, the way a fork mashes into view the inner light of a carrot in a stew. In this late March sunshine, crossing the trees at the angle of a bow when it effleurages out of the chanterelle the C three octaves above middle C, the vertical birthwood remembers its ascent lines, shrunken by half, exactly back down, each tree on its fallen summer. Back then, these rocks often asked blood offerings—but this one, once, asked bone, the time Billy Wallace tripped and broke out his front teeth. Fitted with gold replicas, he asked, speaking more brightly, “What good are golden teeth, given what we’ve got to eat?” Nebuchadnezzar spent seven years down on all fours eating vetch and alfalfa, ruminating the mouth-feel of “bloom” and “wither,” until he was whole. If you held a grass blade between both thumbs and blew hard you could blurt a shriek out of it—like that beseeching leaves oaks didn’t drop last winter just now scratch on a breeze. Maybe Billy, lured by bones’ memory, comes back sometimes, too, to the Seekonk Woods, to stand in the past and just look at it. Here he might kneel, studying this clump of grass, as a god might inspect the strands of a human sneeze that percusses through. Or he might stray into the now untrafficked whistling-lanes of the mourning doves, who used to call and call into the future, and give a start, as though, this very minute, by awful coincidence, they reach it. And at last traipse off down the tracks, with arrhythmic gait, as wanderers must do once they realize: the over-the-unknown route, too, ends up where time wants. On this spot I skinned the muskrat. The musk breezed away. I buried the rat. Of the fur I made a hat, which as soon as put on began to rot off, causing my scalp to crawl. In circles, of course, keeping to the skull. One day could this scrap of damp skin crawl all the way off, and the whole organism follow? To do what? Effuse with musk, or rot with rat? When, a quarter- turn after the sun, the half-moon, too, goes down and we find ourselves in the night's night, then somewhere hereabouts in the dark must be death. Knowledge of it beforehand is surely among existence’s most spectacular feats—and yet right here, on this ordinary afternoon, in these woods, with a name meaning “black goose” in Wampanoag, or in modern Seekonkese, “slob blowing fat nose,” this unlikely event happens—a creature walking the tracks knows it will come. Then too long to touch every tie, his stride is now just too short to reach every other, and so he is to be still the wanderer, the hirtle of too much replaced by the common limp of too little. But he almost got there. Almost stepped in consonance with the liturgical, sleeping gods’ snores you can hear humming up from former times inside the ties. He almost set foot in that border zone where what follows blows back, shimmering everything, making walking like sleepwalking, railroad tracks a country lane on a spring morning, on which a man, limping but blissful, makes his way homeward, his lips, suppled by kissing to bunch up like that, blowing these short strands of hollowed-out air, haunted by future, into a tune on the tracks. I think I’m about to be shocked awake. As I was in childhood, when I battered myself back to my senses against a closed door, or woke up hanging out of an upstairs window. Somnambulism was my attempt to slip under cover of nightmare across no father’s land and embrace a phantasm. If only I had found a way to enter his hard time served at labor by day, by night in solitary, and put my arms around him in reality, I might not now be remaking h@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 The old watch: their thick eyes puff and foreclose by the moon. The young, heads trailed by the beginnings of necks, shiver, in the guarantee they shall be bodies. In the frog pond the vapor trail of a SAC bomber creeps, I hear its drone, drifting, high up in immaculate ozone. 2 And I hear, coming over the hills, America singing, her varied carols I hear: crack of deputies' rifles practicing their aim on stray dogs at night, sput of cattleprod, TV going on about the smells of the human body, curses of the soldier as he poisons, burns, grinds, and stabs the rice of the world, with open mouth, crying strong, hysterical curses. 3 And by paddies in Asia bones wearing a few shadows walk down a dirt road, smashed bloodsuckers on their heel, knowing flesh thrown down in the sunshine dogs shall eat and flesh flung into the air shall be seized by birds, shoulder blades smooth, unmarked by old feather-holes, hands rivered by blue, erratic wanderings of the blood, eyes crinkled shut at almost seeing the drifting sun that gives us our lives.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The crow’s raw hectoring cry scoops clean an oval divot of sky, its fading echo among the oaks and poplars swallowed first by a jet banking west then the Erie-Lackawanna sounding its horn as it comes through the tunnel through the cliffs to the river and around the bend of King’s Cove Bluff, full of timber, Ford chassis, rock salt. You can hear it in the dark from beyond what was once the amusement park. And the wind carries along as well, from down by the river, when the tide’s just so, the drainage just so, the chemical ghost of old factories, the rotted piers and warehouses: lye, pigfat, copra from Lever Bros., formaldehyde from the coffee plant, dyes, unimaginable solvents— a soup of polymers, oxides, tailings fifty years old seeping through the mud, the aroma almost comforting by now, like food, wafting into my childhood room with its fevers and dreams. My old parents asleep, only a few yards across the hall, door open—lest I cry? I remember almost nothing of my life.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A faint smell of urine embroidering that bouquet of mold the big cushions give off days the fog won’t lift, and a shelf of bone growing out over the eyelids like evening’s shadow across a field of corn— The whole parade leaking out from your shoulders, bequeathing to the groin a pang of distance; then that metallic taste in the mouth and a voice you had let yourself believe was dead close now by your ear, intimate and sweet: Well, well, well, look what we have here.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The dog Stoltz pushed his paw pads into my neck, the warm, beaten leather deep under my chin, and let slip the one paw to up near my mouth with all the filth of the many blocks we trod, together trod, a well-moistened, adenoidal sound, part sigh and part growl, coming out of him, transported, he seemed, in a slow-motion delirium as I tickled his chest and behind his ear when he just then told me he’d tear out my throat, looked in my eye and smiled, best as a dog can, then turned ruminative and spoke once more:—I simply have to knock off that essay on Sassoon. This would have been Sassoon the war poet, understand. Dogs cannot write. My mother told me this. As for his talk, well, I took no special notice. His love of the war poets was well known. Stoltz would have been part bull and something else. Two friends walked by just then, handily as these things go, and inquired of us sitting down there on the stoop, not even, a doorway merely, along a busy street, how went the day and what pursuits was I attending; but what interested the two of them most were the tergiversations of the dog Stoltz, first beast, then scholar, then abject and adored. (Say, who among us does not care to be undressed?) He was not really my dog, you see, and of this made note, but were glad as well at my having a new dog in my life. It was a busy stretch of pavement, Amsterdam maybe, or Broadway, or farther down just south of Chelsea. I can tell you it was the West Side, of that I’m certain, and it was mild, spring-like, a few drops in the air. The friends passed along and the dog Stoltz slept. He was not my dog, you know. He simply followed me out of what can only have been a very fine home, such were his graces, his recondite tastes. But he was a killer too, and rather smelled. I cannot accommodate another animal now, please understand. I am between places. I will yearn for Stoltz, but no.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
That bummy smell you meet off the escalator at Civic Center, right before you turn onto McAllister, seems to dwell there, disembodied, on a shelf above the sidewalk. The mad old lady with lizard skin bent double over her shopping cart and trailing a cloud of pigeons is nowhere in sight. A pile of rags here and there but no one underneath. An invisible shrine commemorating what? Old mattresses and dusty flesh, piss and puked-on overcoats, what? Maybe death, now there’s a smell that likes to stick around. You used to find it in downtown Sally Anns and once in a hospital cafeteria, only faintly, after a bite of poundcake. But here it lives, cheek by jowl with McDonald’s, still robust after a night of wind with its own dark little howdy-do for the drunks and cops, social workers and whores, or the elderly couple from Zurich leafing cooly through their guidebook.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Weasel and the Ponce were having a confab under the chinaberry tree, in the shade of the dusty old tree— pious Weasel, indefatigable Ponce. Abroad in the land were pickings to be had, marks beyond measure, fat aplenty for tooth and hand. Will and cunning are the clean, bright edges of a creature in the wild, of a vigorous man, so that goodness finds sustenance, charity nurture, in quietude, in quietude within. The nose will relate to you a world, a world entire, from the merest trace of wind— the topography of weakness, gold in a river’s sand. And there they sniffed, sniffed and with hooded eye conspired, in the shadows thrown by the dusty old tree. Trading knowledge, whetting tools, they made ready for their necessary enterprise, the fate nature bestowed. All the while drinking in each other’s aspect: they found uncommon pleasure there, did Weasel and his friend, in the other’s smile and guise, as a young girl in flattering light, as a darling young girl by her reflection might— the two of them, lovely beyond compare in the shade of the chinaberry tree. Groomed, laved with blandishment, almost gilded in the hours afternoon turns to evening and evening, stealthily, to night, how would they have noticed the rustle in the thicket, felt the heat of its burning eyes?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Green first thing each day sees waves— the chair, armoire, overhead fixtures, you name it, waves—which, you might say, things really are, but Green just lies there awhile breathing long slow breaths, in and out, through his mouth like he was maybe seasick, until in an hour or so the waves simmer down and then the trails and colors off of things, that all quiets down as well and Green starts to think of washing up, breakfast even with everything still moving around, colors, trails, and sounds, from the street and plumbing next door, vibrating—of course you might say that's what sound really is, after all, vibrations—but Green, he's not thinking physics at this stage, nuh-uh, our boy's only trying to get himself out of bed, get a grip, but sometimes, and this is the kicker, another party, shall we say, is in the room with Green, and Green knows this other party and they do not get along, which understates it quite a bit, quite a bit, and Green knows that this other cat is an hallucination, right, but these two have a routine that goes way back and Green starts hollering, throwing stuff until he's all shook up, whole day gone to hell, bummer . . .

Here not long enough after the hospital happened I find her closet lying empty and stop my play And go in and crane up at three blackwire hangers Which quiver, airy, released. They appear to enjoy Their new distance, cognizance born of the absence Of anything else. The closet has been cleaned out Full-flush as surgeries where the hangers could be Amiable scalpels though they just as well would be Themselves, in basements, glovelessly scraping uteri But, here, pure, transfigured heavenward, they’re Birds, whose wingspans expand by excluding me. Their Range is enlarged by loss. They’d leave buzzards Measly as moths: and the hatshelf is even higher!— As the sky over a prairie, an undotted desert where Nothing can swoop sudden, crumple in secret. I’ve fled At ambush, tag, age: six, must I face this, can I have my hide-and-seek hole back now please, the Clothes, the thicket of shoes, where is it? Only The hangers are at home here. Come heir to this Rare element, fluent, their skeletal grace sings Of the ease with which they let go the dress, slip, Housecoat or blouse, so absolvingly. Free, they fly Trim, triangular, augurs leapt ahead from some geometric God who soars stripped (of flesh, it is said): catnip To a brat placated by model airplane kits kids My size lack motorskills for, I wind up glue-scabbed, Pawing goo-goo fingernails, glaze skins fun to peer in as Frost-i-glass doors ... But the closet has no windows, Opaque or sheer: I must shut my eyes, shrink within To peep into this wall. Soliciting sleep I’ll dream Mother spilled and cold, unpillowed, the operating- Table cracked to goad delivery: its stirrups slack, Its forceps closed: by it I’ll see mobs of obstetrical Personnel kneel proud, congratulatory, cooing And oohing and hold the dead infant up to the dead Woman’s face as if for approval, the prompted Beholding, tears, a zoomshot kiss. White-masked Doctors and nurses patting each other on the back, Which is how in the Old West a hangman, if He was good, could gauge the heft of his intended ... Awake, the hangers are sharper, knife-’n’-slice, I jump Helplessly to catch them to twist them clear, Mis-shape them whole, sail them across the small air Space of the closet. I shall find room enough here By excluding myself; by excluding myself, I’ll grow.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In Tamalpais is a big crystal. An acquaintance told me the story. A Miwok was giving his grandfather’s medicine bag to the Kroeber Museum in Berkeley. He said this man took him over the mountain Tamalpais, at a certain time in the year. I believe it was about the time of the Winter Solstice, because then the tides are really low. They stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over the mountain. On their way to the Bolinas Beach clam patch, where there is a big rock way out there. Go out to the rock. Take out of the medicine bag the crystal that matches the crystal in Tamalpais. And if your heart is not true if your heart is not true when you tap the rock in the clam patch a little piece of it will fly off and strike you in the heart and strike you dead. And that’s the first story I ever heard about Bolinas.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1. It unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward. All the stories come folding out. The smells and flowers begin to come back, as the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded. Rabbits and violets. Who asked you to come over? She got her foot in the door and would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly. Gas leak? that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had better check with the landlord. This was no better than the predicament I had just read about. Now it was actually changing before my eyes. Sometimes it will come to a standstill though, and finally the reflection can begin. Selfless—that was the proposition. Smiling and moving instantly there was no other purpose than that which brought them there, to be in a particular place. 2. This time the mule gave its face away. Take your cadillac where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be, and enjoy a good bottle of rum. Running on this way she used various modes of expression that were current. Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer. What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility of her mind. At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation was built up. Here through various regulated artificial conditions, spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed her ideal concept of nature. The smell was overpowering. All right then. She had a thing about nature, from flower show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated. A beauty of cultivation—in living? Hastiness did not prevent her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, “OH OH the life I am entangled in.” Four sides of it. Above was a paradisical level, incompleted. With working possibilities. Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible. Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new bedspread and color scheme for pillows. Taste treats were unresponsive. Glamor do’s were out. Conversation was nil. Languid she could not even find a place to languish upon that was fulfilling in its own way. So out of the lifelessness that was around her, the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was sprouting, she thought, Why not fantasy? Tugging at this character and that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half- blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller. Here the four walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again. “I ought to tighten down and make sure I say exactly what I mean.” And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way. Use every tidbit, usefully. Once upon a time there was a princess who had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors. The princess languished. She was not sure where to sit to her best advantage to enjoy herself the most. She could not go in her mind or out. She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was a princess. She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of eden, the coat spread around her. No, that poor little house she had built was a bore. It’s better that it go up in flames, as it did. She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers. Some people took them and some people didn’t. 3. I’m glad to get back. I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey. Questioning myself all along the way. Was I jumping on her because her time had come to an end. Indeed I pounded on his arm all night, over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing but their softness. Me ME, and the time we might spend together, reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk. My flippancy is gone. Now I have started my secret life again, in transition, reminding. As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money. All over@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I don’t think it’s cool, I replied. Oh, said he, after a pause, I should have waited for you to ask me. The waves came in closer and closer. When I fall into the gap of suspicion I am no longer here. In this world that has got closed over by houses and networks, I fly out from under the belly. Life’s dizzy crown of whirling lights, circles this head. Pure with wonder, hot with wonder. The streets become golden. All size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth. We are in easy understanding. Scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us. It is memory. As I search to find this day’s sweet drifting. The fog out to sea, the wind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The Year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, Of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, Some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d For festival, some reckless of attire. The snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers Had withered in the meadow; fig and prune Hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid Its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt Between the trodden corn and twisted vine, Under whose bunches stood the empty crate, To creak ere long beneath them carried home. This was the season when twelve months before, O gentle Hamadryad, true to love! Thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood Was blasted and laid desolate: but none Dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck The moss beneath it, which alone remain’d Of what was thine. Old Thallinos sat mute In solitary sadness. The strange tale (Not until Rhaicos died, but then the whole) Echion had related, whom no force Could ever make look back upon the oaks. The father said “Echion! thou must weigh, Carefully, and with steady hand, enough (Although no longer comes the store as once!) Of wax to burn all day and night upon That hollow stone where milk and honey lie: So may the Gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” Thallinos bore it thither in the morn, And lighted it and left it. First of those Who visited upon this solemn day The Hamadryad’s oak, were Rhodope And Acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. Graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate She sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first Lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands Were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. Now stood the two aside the hollow stone And lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak Shivered and black and bare. “May never we Love as they loved!” said Acon. She at this Smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, And thought not of its bliss, but of its end. He caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d Nor time nor other power, whereto the might Of love hath yielded and may yield again, Should alter his. The father of the youth Wanted not beauty for him, wanted not Song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, Discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, Innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; Silver and gold and land, not green before The ancestral gate, but purple under skies Bending far off, he wanted for his heir. Fathers have given life, but virgin heart They never gave; and dare they then control Or check it harshly? dare they break a bond Girt round it by the holiest Power on high? Acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, But Acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful! Crush thy own heart, Man! Man! but fear to wound The gentler, that relies on thee alone, By thee created, weak or strong by thee; Touch it not but for worship; watch before Its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed The temple-doors and the last lamp is spent. Rhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude, Sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, Often not hearing it, and many tears Had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. Meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, Nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone That held the milk and honey, nor to lay His plighted hand where recently ’twas laid Opposite hers, when finger playfully Advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. He did not think of this, as she would do If she were there alone. The day was hot; The moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek, It cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it And sank to slumber. Never was there dream Divine as his. He saw the Hamadryad. She took him by the arm and led him on Along a valley, where profusely grew The smaller lilies with their pendent bells, And, hiding under mint, chill drosera, The violet shy of butting cyclamen, The feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, Her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; The quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, The oleander’s light-hair’d progeny Breathing bright freshness in each other’s face, And graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup Of fragrance and of beauty, boon for Gods. The fragrance fill’d his breast@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

“Do you remember me? or are you proud?” Lightly advancing thro’ her star-trimm’d crowd, Ianthe said, and lookt into my eyes, “A yes, a yes, to both: for Memory Where you but once have been must ever be, And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Here, where precipitate Spring with one light bound Into hot Summer’s lusty arms expires; And where go forth at morn, at eve, at night, Soft airs, that want the lute to play with them, And softer sighs, that know not what they want; Under a wall, beneath an orange-tree Whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier ones Of sights in Fiesole right up above, While I was gazing a few paces off At what they seemed to show me with their nods, Their frequent whispers and their pointing shoots, A gentle maid came down the garden-steps And gathered the pure treasure in her lap. I heard the branches rustle, and stept forth To drive the ox away, or mule, or goat, (Such I believed it must be); for sweet scents Are the swift vehicles of still sweeter thoughts, And nurse and pillow the dull memory That would let drop without them her best stores. They bring me tales of youth and tones of love, And ’tis and ever was my wish and way To let all flowers live freely, and all die, Whene’er their Genius bids their souls depart, Among their kindred in their native place. I never pluck the rose; the violet’s head Hath shaken with my breath upon its bank And not reproacht me; the ever-sacred cup Of the pure lily hath between my hands Felt safe, unsoil’d, nor lost one grain of gold. I saw the light that made the glossy leaves More glossy; the fair arm, the fairer cheek Warmed by the eye intent on its pursuit; I saw the foot, that, altho half-erect From its grey slipper, could not lift her up To what she wanted: I held down a branch And gather’d her some blossoms, since their hour Was come, and bees had wounded them, and flies Of harder wing were working their way thro And scattering them in fragments under foot. So crisp were some, they rattled unevolved, Others, ere broken off, fell into shells, For such appear the petals when detacht, Unbending, brittle, lucid, white like snow, And like snow not seen thro, by eye or sun: Yet every one her gown received from me Was fairer than the first . . I thought not so, But so she praised them to reward my care. I said: you find the largest. This indeed, Cried she, is large and sweet. She held one forth, Whether for me to look at or to take She knew not, nor did I; but taking it Would best have solved (and this she felt) her doubts. I dared not touch it; for it seemed a part Of her own self; fresh, full, the most mature Of blossoms, yet a blossom; with a touch To fall, and yet unfallen. She drew back The boon she tendered, and then, finding not The ribbon at her waist to fix it in, Dropt it, as loth to drop it, on the rest.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Ianthe! you are call’d to cross the sea! A path forbidden me! Remember, while the Sun his blessing sheds Upon the mountain-heads, How often we have watcht him laying down His brow, and dropt our own Against each other’s, and how faint and short And sliding the support! What will succeed it now? Mine is unblest, Ianthe! nor will rest But on the very thought that swells with pain. O bid me hope again! O give me back what Earth, what (without you) Not Heaven itself can do— One of the golden days that we have past, And let it be my last! Or else the gift would be, however sweet, Fragile and incomplete.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I loved him not; and yet, now he is gone, I feel I am alone. I check’d him while he spoke; yet, could he speak, Alas! I would not check. For reasons not to love him once I sought, And wearied all my thought To vex myself and him: I now would give My love could he but live Who lately lived for me, and, when he found ’Twas vain, in holy ground He hid his face amid the shades of death. I waste for him my breath Who wasted his for me! but mine returns, And this lorn bosom burns With stifling heat, heaving it up in sleep, And waking me to weep Tears that had melted his soft heart: for years Wept he as bitter tears. Merciful God! such was his latest prayer, These may she never share. Quieter is his breath, his breast more cold, Than daisies in the mould, Where children spell, athwart the churchyard gate, His name and life’s brief date. Pray for him, gentle souls, whoe’er you be, And oh! pray too for me!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Mild is the parting year, and sweet The odour of the falling spray; Life passes on more rudely fleet, And balmless is its closing day. I wait its close, I court its gloom, But mourn that never must there fall Or on my breast or on my tomb The tear that would have soothed it all.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Mother, I cannot mind my wheel; My fingers ache, my lips are dry: Oh! if you felt the pain I feel! But Oh, who ever felt as I! No longer could I doubt him true; All other men may use deceit: He always said my eyes were blue, And often swore my lips were sweet.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Ah what avails the sceptred race, Ah what the form divine! What every virtue, every grace! Rose Aylmer, all were thine. Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes May weep, but never see, A night of memories and of sighs I consecrate to thee.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Soon, O Ianthe! life is o’er, And sooner beauty’s heavenly smile: Grant only (and I ask no more), Let love remain that little while.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There is delight in singing, tho’ none hear Beside the singer; and there is delight In praising, tho’ the praiser sit alone And see the prais’d far off him, far above. Shakspeare is not our poet, but the world’s, Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, No man hath walkt along our roads with step So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue So varied in discourse. But warmer climes Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where The Siren waits thee, singing song for song.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You smiled, you spoke, and I believed, By every word and smile deceived. Another man would hope no more; Nor hope I what I hoped before: But let not this last wish be vain; Deceive, deceive me once again!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I'm remembering again, the day we stood on the porch and you smoked while the old man told you about his basement full of wine, his bad heart and the doctor's warning, how he held the dusty bottle out to you, glad, he said, to give it away to someone who appreciated its value and spirit, the years it took to settle into its richness and worth. I'm watching again, each cell alive, as you reach for the wine, your forearm exposed below the rolled sleeve, the fine hairs that sweep along the muscle, glowing, lifting a little in the afternoon breeze. I'm memorizing the shape of the moment: your hand and the small bones lengthening beneath the skin as it tightens in the gripping, in the receiving of the gift, the exact texture and color of your skin, and the old man's face, reduced to its essence. That, and the brief second when both of you had a hand on the bottle— the thing not yet given, not yet taken, but held between you, stoppered, full. And my body is flooded again with an elemental joy, holding onto it against another day in the unknowable future when I'm given terrible news, some dark burden I'll be forced to carry. I know this is useless, and can't possibly work, but I'm saving that moment, for balance.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
For days now a red-breasted bird has been trying to break in. She tests a low branch, violet blossoms swaying beside her, leaps into the air and flies straight at my window, beak and breast held back, claws raking the pane. Maybe she longs for the tree she sees reflected in the glass, but I'm only guessing. I watch until she gives up and swoops off. I wait for her return, the familiar click, swoosh, thump of her. I sip cold coffee and scan the room, trying to see it new, through the eyes of a bird. Nothing has changed. Books piled in a corner, coats hooked over chair backs, paper plates, a cup half-filled with sour milk. The children are in school. The man is at work. I'm alone with dead roses in a jam jar. What do I have that she could want enough to risk such failure, again and again?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When you’re cold—November, the streets icy and everyone you pass homeless, Goodwill coats and Hefty bags torn up to make ponchos— someone is always at the pay phone, hunched over the receiver spewing winter’s germs, swollen lipped, face chapped, making the last tired connection of the day. You keep walking to keep the cold at bay, too cold to wait for the bus, too depressing the thought of entering that blue light, the chilled eyes watching you decide which seat to take: the man with one leg, his crutches bumping the smudged window glass, the woman with her purse clutched to her breasts like a dead child, the boy, pimpled, morose, his head shorn, a swastika carved into the stubble, staring you down. So you walk into the cold you know: the wind, indifferent blade, familiar, the gold leaves heaped along the gutters. You have a home, a house with gas heat, a toilet that flushes. You have a credit card, cash. You could take a taxi if one would show up. You can feel it now: why people become Republicans: Get that dog off the street. Remove that spit and graffiti. Arrest those people huddled on the steps of the church. If it weren’t for them you could believe in god, in freedom, the bus would appear and open its doors, the driver dressed in his tan uniform, pants legs creased, dapper hat: Hello Miss, watch your step now. But you’re not a Republican. You’re only tired, hungry, you want out of the cold. So you give up, walk back, step into line behind the grubby vet who hides a bag of wine under his pea coat, holds out his grimy 85 cents, takes each step slow as he pleases, releases his coins into the box and waits as they chink down the chute, stakes out a seat in the back and eases his body into the stained vinyl to dream as the chips of shrapnel in his knee warm up and his good leg flops into the aisle. And you’ll doze off, too, in a while, next to the girl who can’t sit still, who listens to her Walkman and taps her boots to a rhythm you can’t hear, but you can see it—when she bops her head and her hands do a jive in the air—you can feel it as the bus rolls on, stopping at each red light in a long wheeze, jerking and idling, rumbling up and lurching off again.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Someone spoke to me last night, told me the truth. Just a few words, but I recognized it. I knew I should make myself get up, write it down, but it was late, and I was exhausted from working all day in the garden, moving rocks. Now, I remember only the flavor — not like food, sweet or sharp. More like a fine powder, like dust. And I wasn’﻿t elated or frightened, but simply rapt, aware. That’﻿s how it is sometimes — God comes to your window, all bright light and black wings, and you’﻿re just too tired to open it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Sometimes, when we're on a long drive, and we've talked enough and listened to enough music and stopped twice, once to eat, once to see the view, we fall into this rhythm of silence. It swings back and forth between us like a rope over a lake. Maybe it's what we don't say that saves us.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family, how an argument once ended when his father seized a lit birthday cake in both hands and hurled it out a second-story window. That, I thought, was what a normal family was like: anger sent out across the sill, landing like a gift to decorate the sidewalk below. In mine it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus, and nobody ever forgave anyone. But I believed the people in his stories really loved one another, even when they yelled and shoved their feet through cabinet doors, or held a chair like a bottle of cheap champagne, christening the wall, rungs exploding from their holes. I said it sounded harmless, the pomp and fury of the passionate. He said it was a curse being born Italian and Catholic and when he looked from that window what he saw was the moment rudely crushed. But all I could see was a gorgeous three-layer cake gliding like a battered ship down the sidewalk, the smoking candles broken, sunk deep in the icing, a few still burning.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Before the days of self service, when you never had to pump your own gas, I was the one who did it for you, the girl who stepped out at the sound of a bell with a blue rag in my hand, my hair pulled back in a straight, unlovely ponytail. This was before automatic shut-offs and vapor seals, and once, while filling a tank, I hit a bubble of trapped air and the gas backed up, came arcing out of the hole in a bright gold wave and soaked me — face, breasts, belly and legs. And I had to hurry back to the booth, the small employee bathroom with the broken lock, to change my uniform, peel the gas-soaked cloth from my skin and wash myself in the sink. Light-headed, scrubbed raw, I felt pure and amazed — the way the amber gas glazed my flesh, the searing, subterranean pain of it, how my skin shimmered and ached, glowed like rainbowed oil on the pavement. I was twenty. In a few weeks I would fall, for the first time, in love, that man waiting patiently in my future like a red leaf on the sidewalk, the kind of beauty that asks to be noticed. How was I to know it would begin this way: every cell of my body burning with a dangerous beauty, the air around me a nimbus of light that would carry me through the days, how when he found me, weeks later, he would find me like that, an ordinary woman who could rise in flame, all he would have to do is come close and touch me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
No matter what the grief, its weight, we are obliged to carry it. We rise and gather momentum, the dull strength that pushes us through crowds. And then the young boy gives me directions so avidly. A woman holds the glass door open, waiting patiently for my empty body to pass through. All day it continues, each kindness reaching toward another—a stranger singing to no one as I pass on the path, trees offering their blossoms, a child who lifts his almond eyes and smiles. Somehow they always find me, seem even to be waiting, determined to keep me from myself, from the thing that calls to me as it must have once called to them— this temptation to step off the edge and fall weightless, away from the world.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The heart shifts shape of its own accord— from bird to ax, from pinwheel to budded branch. It rolls over in the chest, a brown bear groggy with winter, skips like a child at the fair, stopping in the shade of the fireworks booth, the fat lady's tent, the corn dog stand. Or the heart is an empty room where the ghosts of the dead wait, paging through magazines, licking their skinless thumbs. One gets up, walks through a door into a maze of hallways. Behind one door a roomful of orchids, behind another, the smell of burned toast. The rooms go on and on: sewing room with its squeaky treadle, its bright needles, room full of file cabinets and torn curtains, room buzzing with a thousand black flies. Or the heart closes its doors, becomes smoke, a wispy lie, curls like a worm and forgets its life, burrows into the fleshy dirt. Heart makes a wrong turn. Heart locked in its gate of thorns. Heart with its hands folded in its lap. Heart a blue skiff parting the silk of the lake. It does what it wants, takes what it needs, eats when it's hungry, sleeps when the soul shuts down. Bored, it watches movies deep into the night, stands by the window counting the streetlamps squinting out one by one. Heart with its hundred mouths open. Heart with its hundred eyes closed. Harmonica heart, heart of tinsel, heart of cement, broken teeth, redwood fence. Heart of bricks and boards, books stacked in devoted rows, their dusty spines unreadable. Heart with its hands full. Hieroglyph heart, etched deep with history's lists, things to do. Near-sighted heart. Club-footed heart. Hard-headed heart. Heart of gold, coal. Bad juju heart, singing the low down blues. Choir boy heart. Heart in a frumpy robe. Heart with its feet up reading the scores. Homeless heart, dozing, its back against the Dumpster. Cop-on-the-beat heart with its black billy club, banging on the lid.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
At the high school football game, the boys stroke their new muscles, the girls sweeten their lips with gloss that smells of bubblegum, candy cane, or cinnamon. In pleated cheerleader skirts they walk home with each other, practicing yells, their long bare legs forming in the dark. Under the arched field lights a girl in a velvet prom dress stands near the chainlink, a cone of roses held between her breasts. Her lanky father, in a corduroy suit, leans against the fence. While they talk, she slips a foot in and out of a new white pump, fingers the weave of her French braid, the glittering earrings. They could be a couple on their first date, she, a little shy, he, trying to impress her with his casual stance. This is the moment when she learns what she will love: a warm night, the feel of nylon between her thighs, the fine hairs on her arms lifting when a breeze sifts in through the bleachers, cars igniting their engines, a man bending over her, smelling the flowers pressed against her neck.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
and remote, and useful, if only to itself. Take the fly, angel of the ordinary house, laying its bright eggs on the trash, pressing each jewel out delicately along a crust of buttered toast. Bagged, the whole mess travels to the nearest dump where other flies have gathered, singing over stained newsprint and reeking fruit. Rapt on air they execute an intricate ballet above the clashing pirouettes of heavy machinery. They hum with life. While inside rumpled sacks pure white maggots writhe and spiral from a rip, a tear-shaped hole that drools and drips a living froth onto the buried earth. The warm days pass, gulls scree and pitch, rats manage the crevices, feral cats abandon their litters for a morsel of torn fur, stranded dogs roam open fields, sniff the fragrant edges, a tossed lacework of bones and shredded flesh. And the maggots tumble at the center, ripening, husks membrane-thin, embryos darkening and shifting within, wings curled and wet, the open air pungent and ready to receive them in their fecund iridescence. And so, of our homely hosts, a bag of jewels is born again into the world. Come, lost children of the sun-drenched kitchen, your parents soundly sleep along the windowsill, content, wings at rest, nestled in against the warm glass. Everywhere the good life oozes from the useless waste we make when we create—our streets teem with human young, rafts of pigeons streaming over the squirrel-burdened trees. If there is a purpose, maybe there are too many of us to see it, though we can, from a distance, hear the dull thrum of generation's industry, feel its fleshly wheel churn the fire inside us, pushing the world forward toward its ragged edge, rushing like a swollen river into multitude and rank disorder. Such abundance. We are gorged, engorging, and gorgeous.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Bless this boy, born with the strong face of my older brother, the one I loved most, who jumped with me from the roof of the playhouse, my hand in his hand. On Friday nights we watched Twilight Zone and he let me hold the bowl of popcorn, a blanket draped over our shoulders, saying, Don't be afraid. I was never afraid when I was with my big brother who let me touch the baseball-size muscles living in his arms, who carried me on his back through the lonely neighborhood, held tight to the fender of my bike until I made him let go. The year he was fourteen he looked just like Ray, and when he died at twenty-two on a roadside in Germany I thought he was gone forever. But Ray runs into the kitchen: dirty T-shirt, torn jeans, pushes back his sleeve. He says, Feel my muscle, and I do.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
She never spoke, which made her obvious, the way death makes the air obvious in an empty chair, the way sky compressed between bare branches is more gray or blue, the way a window is more apparent than a wall. She held her silence to her breast like a worn coat, smoke, an armful of roses. Her silence colored the smaller silences that came and went, that other students stood up and filled in. I leaned near the window in my office. She sat on the edge of a chair. Hips rigid, fidgeting while I made my little speech. February light pressed its cold back against the glass, sealing us in. She focused on my lips as I spoke, as if to study how it's done, the sheer mechanics of it: orchestration of jaw and tongue, teeth shifting in tandem, shaping the air. So I stopped, let her silence drift over us, let it sift in like smoke or snow, let its petals settle on my shoulders. I looked outside to the branches of a stripped tree, winter starlings folded in their speckled wings, chilled flames shuddering at the tips. Students wandered across campus as if under water, hands and hair unfurling, their soundless mouths churning— irate or ecstatic, I couldn't tell—ready to burn it all down or break into song. When I looked back her eyes had found the window: tree, students, birds swimming by, mute in their element. It was painful to hear the papery rasp of her folding and unfolding hands, to watch color smudging her neck and temple, branching to mist the delicate rim of one ear. I listened to the air sunder between us, the feverish hush collapse. I could hear her breath—smoke rising from ice. I could see what it cost her to make that leap. What heat it takes for the body to blossom into speech.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The slate black sky. The middle step of the back porch. And long ago my mother’s necklace, the beads rolling north and south. Broken the rose stem, water into drops, glass knobs on the bedroom door. Last summer’s pot of parsley and mint, white roots shooting like streamers through the cracks. Years ago the cat’s tail, the bird bath, the car hood’s rusted latch. Broken little finger on my right hand at birth— I was pulled out too fast. What hasn’t been rent, divided, split? Broken the days into nights, the night sky into stars, the stars into patterns I make up as I trace them with a broken-off blade of grass. Possible, unthinkable, the cricket’s tiny back as I lie on the lawn in the dark, my heart a blue cup fallen from someone’s hands.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 In the Forest of Wearisome Sadness,Where one day I found myself wandering alone,I met my heart, who called to me, asking me where I was going.The path was long and straight, row after row of conifers recedingTo a horizon that because of the geometrySeemed farther than it really was,Like the door at the top of a staircase in Versailles.But as if the forest’s maker had been offended by elegance,A pile of rocks disrupted the rows: the forest onceHad been a field. I remember that field. I was carried there by my father, beside him My grandfather, who planted the trees. Until they were tall enough to survive,He mowed the field, piling up rocks, taking down brush with a scythe.How, since I’ve known the forest almost since birth, could I have been lost?Why, since the forest is beautiful, is it not a place of delight? Repeatedly I asked these questions of my heart, But like a good physician, he elected To keep silent, leaving me to answer for myself.2 Late at night, when I’m lying in bed and cannot sleep,My heart reads to me from the Romance of Pleasant Thought. Always I’ve heard the story before, and typically, Since the stories are true, I am their hero.I’m riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where I was born.Because I am unsupervised, I indulge in what seems at the moment A daring wish: I ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler.Immediately I am overcome with remorse.The evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen,And for the first time in my life I contemplate a lie. Would my shirt dry faster if I stood in the sun, where it’s hot,Or in the shade, where cool breezes rustle the leaves?In the version of this story that appears nowIn the Romance of Pleasant Thought,I admire not so much my ingenuityAs the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism,The way I manage terror by examining how things work. 3 It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.My heart is gone from me.Because he has fallen in loveHe has abandoned me.It’s pointless making myself uncomfortable over thisBy being mournful or sad.It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.My heart is gone from me.He does nothing but mock me.When I tell him pitifullyThat I cannot live on my own,He does not listen.It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.After Charles d’Orleans 4 Imagine you’ve been in love forever, since before you were born.You walk the field. At every third stepYou scoop out a handful of wheatFrom the seed bag, scattering it broadcast.As the sun comes up, you’re walking in a golden cloud.Inside the cloud, time no longer exists.Your back’s not bent, your body is a boy’s.Outside, since it’s time for wheat, the summer rains are finished.Otherwise it’s oats. Every third year it’s clover.You’re tired of walking, of sowing, tired of being in love.The advantage to people like you,Though there are many disadvantages, is this:When the earth no longer needs what you can growYou plant hundreds, then thousandsOf seedlings, conifers, trees that bear no edible fruit.You arrange them in rows, you tend them,You’re proud of them.You make the field disappear.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 Just as there were reeds along the riverbank,Just as there were cloudsAbove my head, my lute was lying beside me on the grass.I placed the little finger of my right hand on the soundboard,Just below the strings.Not the tip of the finger, the side.I curled the palm of my right hand towards me,Covering the strings, so that I playedThe bass note with the thumb,The next with the index,And the top note with the third.The sun retreated, the night turned cold.Rain began to fall, softly at first,Though surely rain had fallen here before, as rain falls everywhere.With my left hand, I positioned my thumb and index fingerOpposite each other, bearing no weight,As if the neck of the lute were not there.2 At this they all laughed.Then the Count began afresh: My lords, he said, I am not pleased with the young man if he is not also a musician, and if, besides his cunning upon the book, he have not skill in like manner on sundry instruments. There is no ease of labor more honest and more praiseworthy, especially at court, where many things are taken in hand to please women, whose tender breasts are soon pierced with melody. Then the Lord Gasper: I believe music, he said, together with other vanities, is mete for women, also for them that have the likeness of men, but not for them that be men indeed, who ought not with such delicacies womanize their minds and so bring themselves to dread death. — The First Booke of the Courtyer of Count Baldessar Castilio 3 For many years I lived apart, in happy oblivion. In retrospect, I understand I’d been a child, Though lacking comparisons I couldn’t have said so. I learned things, things no child, left to himself, could possibly know. My head, which had been empty, now was full. My head would grow larger. How could it not? At night, standing in the shower, I closed my eyes. The water trickled down my forehead To my nose, from my nose to my lips, my chin, then disappeared. But some of what stayed in my head Should not have been there.4 Listen, said the reeds along the riverbank: the nymphs Are weeping for Daphnis. His mother embraces his body, railing against the stars. Nobody drives his cattle to the cool stream, no one could drink; The mountains echo with the beasts of the desert. Daphnis, it was you who yoked them to the chariot, Who led us in the dance, weaving Together vine leaves with reeds. The vine exceeds the tree on which it climbs. The grape exceeds the vine, The calf the herd, the corn the field. Now, where we planted barley, thistles grow. Where once were violets, hyacinths — nothing but weeds. Scatter the ground with flowers, shepherds, Set out two bowls, One of milk and one of oil. Then carve these lines from Virgil on his tomb:I was Daphnis in these woods. The stars knew my name. Beautiful the flock, more beautiful the shepherd.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Empedocles on Etna is a poem By the Victorian poet Matthew Arnold. Readily I’ll concede that poetry is a criticism of life (his phrase) About as much as red-hot iron Is a criticism of fire, ___ But we’re in Sicily. The gods are still with us. The sun has warmed the rocks On which we’re lounging, eating goat cheese, drinking new wine. You’re hardly wearing any clothes. ___ Nobody’s wearing clothes! Neither is anyone Worried about sunlight. This is before Jesus, before Socrates, Before the double onslaught of guilt and rationality ___ Doomed us (I’m paraphrasing Nietzsche) to believe In the rectification of the world Through knowledge—to live Within the limited circle of soluble problems, Where we may cheerfully say to life ___ I want you! You’re worth knowing! Empedocles is having a bad day. Once, he was a god; Smart, good-looking, too. You understand how anyone might feel that way ___ Just being where we are, tasting things, just breathing the air. Above us, Etna’s cone Emits its languorous white plume. Miracles? Mistrust them, says Empedocles.Mind is a spell that governs ___Heaven and earth.Is it so small a thingTo have enjoyed the sun,To have lived lightly in the spring,To have loved, to have thought, to have done? ___ Obvious as the answer to this question may be, convincing, too, Empedocles climbs beyond the ashen trees, The potholes red as an open wound, And steps into a cloud. A poem of passive suffering, said Arnold, ___ Could have no place in his collected poems. No place! His greatest poem! Whose suffering Isn’t passive? What else Could suffering be? One night in Venice ___ I couldn’t sleep; I heard the bells Of San Giacomo ring four times, then five. I heard the mutter of a boat, two voices, a woman’s and a man’s, Then somehow rising Between them, as from the water itself, ___ The Chopin barcarolle. Where were they going? Who could they have been? Why were they playing Chopin In their little boat, playing it softly, just for me? Remember ___ When we lived like forest creatures, You and I, when all We left behind were footsteps Crushed in the wet grass? When I opened my eyes ___ Sun-stirred water played Across the ceiling; You were asleep. It felt like being In the present, being alive.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Imagine cities you’ve Inhabited, streets Paved in lava stone. You never intended to pray In the temples, had Nothing to sell. Now imagine yourself Returning to those same cities. Hunt for people you knew, Knock on their doors. Ask yourself Where are the vases, animals Etched in gold? Where are the wines From distant places, Banquets ferreted From the bowels of the earth? While you were missing Other people wore Your garments, Slept in your bed. How frightening The man who said In his affliction Wood has hope. Cut down It will flourish. If the root grows old And the trunk withers In dust, at the scent of water It will germinate.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Today, no matter if it rains,It’s time to follow the path into the forest.The same people will be walking the same dogs,Or if not the same dogs, dogs that behave in similar fashions,Some barking, some standing aloof.The owners carry plastic bags.But this is the forest, they complain, we must do as we like.We must let the dogs run free,We must follow their example,The way we did when we were young.Back then we slept, watched TV—We were the dogs.By the time the screen door slammed, we were gone.Nobody really talks like that in the forest.They’re proud of their dogs,Proud especially of the ones who never bark.They’re upset about the Norway maple, it’s everywhere,Crowding out the hickories and oaks.Did you know it takes a million seeds to make one tree?Your chances of surviving in the forest,Of replicating yourself, are slim. Today, the smaller dogs are wearing raincoats,The bigger ones are stiffing it out.They’re tense, preoccupied,Running in circles,Getting tangled in the leash—It’s hard remaining human in the forest.To move the limbs of the body,To speak intelligible words,These things promise change.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One cuts blocks From the abundant river, Hauls them house to house. One falls, unseen, The heart Inoculated cold Against a sky still moving. Moving even now Above the river, The canal. Willows shimmering Across the water, Muskrats diving out of reach. The river whispers Till it freezes— A body Twirling sluggishly Beneath the surface as again One stack, then Spreads the straw. Another falters, Slips, or Puts a sliver on your tongue To feel it melting there— The ice-lit Underworld Of someone else.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I painted, everybody saw.When I played piano, everybody heard.

I can undress by the window, I can sleep in the barn.The sky, which is cloudy, Suits the earth to which it belongs.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 Outside the room where you have lived a long time Are other rooms, another building, just like yours. Each night a ship sails past, wider than the building, taller than the highest church. And though the passengers would like to visit the city, No one in the city ever boards the ship. Would you? Each night this spectacle is seen by you. The street surveyed, The air inhaled. Grapes from the west, Cinnamon from the east — If I’ve employed too liberally the passive voice, Remember it’s the thoughts, The feelings that are of consequence here, Not the one who feels them. 2 Shall we walk to the market? You could walk there blind, like Gloucester, smelling your way. Shall we stop for coffee? Which café? The one that’s commandeered by women, delicate cups? Or the one where men preside, baristas in tuxedos, the coffee rich enough for rainy days? A window, the desk, a lamp, and a chair — You’ve liked the room, you like to rearrange it for winter, Put things back for spring. But you’ve been young for a long time, An embarrassingly long time. Look what you wrote! Remember how much, despite Your ridiculous behavior, you’ve been loved. 3 The city never changes, it’s never the same. Sometimes the inhabitants restore a building, patch it up, But in a generation they’re dissatisfied, they try again, Expose the old parts so you see them Plainly, ruined or not. Who schooled you? What made you scared of change? Vividly you remember a child’s body; likewise you remember a man’s. You woke up one morning, There you were, a stinking adult. What happened between? What will it be like, You’ve seen the images, to watch your body spoiling From the inside out, your lungs, your arms, The muscles in your face — Look out the window, Choose a single brick. Once, a long time ago, the city was old. 4 Clouds desire the sky, the sky the sun. The wave Desires the land on which it trembles, Repeating the same question, day after day — Am I allowed to ask for what I want? And every day the land responds,Of course you’re allowed.You’re allowed to be angry, to rail, You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here. I’ve buried many people, old people, young people. I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave. But I’ve also seen miracles. Remember when they told you You might die? You didn’t, you’re alive. And every month since then, each minute, every second is a miracle. What happens next you cannot know. Is it better or worse to live longer? Really the words better and worse do not obtain. And when the land stops speaking The wave flows out to sea. 5 Close your eyes, unclench your hands. Relax each muscle in your body, first your forehead, then your neck, Your chest, your arms, how young you are, you’ve never Done this before, you’ve done it a thousand times — Outside, the walls of San Trovaso are streaked with gold. Boats are knocking against the Giudecca. If you stand on tiptoes you can see, above the chimney pots, its glistening rim. Look at all the people, look at their dogs! They’re nothing like you, And they’re here. Who brought you here, who made the bed? That gasp of pleasure when you entered the room, First touched the walls, Whose was it, if it wasn’t yours?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

They arrived at the desk of the Hotel Duncanand Smithed in, twitchy as flea-drummed squirrels.Her coat was squared and cream, his patent shoeswere little boats you wouldn’t put to sea in.People, not meaning to, write themselves into the soap that your life is, rise or fall in the plot.Seems that they were fleeing from the 1980smuch as a hummingbird flies from a flower’s bell.These were the times when wine was still a treat and not yet considered a common bodily fluid.You will have heard that the mind works muchas an oval of soap turned between two hands.She went round the room seeking lightsthat could be off without desire becoming love.He spread his arms behind his head, a gestureof libido she misread as test of temperature.Every carpet has its weave and underlay, seen only by the maker, the deliverer and the layer.The year was a dog but the day was as good as a song that ends with a wedding, meat on the rib.Evening was folding over the grid, slick walkerswith armfuls of books splendored in dusk’s ask.The song of the pipes was eerie as a face pressedto glass, as a basketball with a mouth and teeth.They lay in the glow of the times and talked ofhow people form a queue to exact or escape love.Each sigh has a sequel, she thought, then he did,then the whole hotel pulsed through that thought.Scandal has an inroad, but you must tunnel out;she rose and stood up counting, all hair and beauty.Though we do not hear them, beneath our own,our shadows’ footsteps clatter, they match our dread.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Though the amaryllis sags and spills so do those my wishes serve, all along the town. And yes, the new moon, kinked there in night's patch, tugs me so—but I can't reach to right the slant. And though our cat pads past without a tail, some with slinking tails peer one-eyed at the dawn, some with eyes are clawless, some with sparking claws contain no voice with which to sing of foxes gassing in the lane. Round-shouldered pals parade smart shirts, while my broad back supports a scrubby jumper, fawn or taupe. The balding English air their stubble while some headless hero sports a feathered hat. I know a man whose thoroughbred grazes in his porch for want of livery. There are scholars of Kant who can't find Kent on the map, and men of Kent who cannot fathom Kant. We who would polish off a feast have lain late in our beds, our bellies groaning, throats on fire. We who'd drain a vat of wine have drunk our own blood for its sting. Each of us in tatters flaunts one treasured garment flapping in the wind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I realise it’s not all salad sandwiches at pinewood picnics, endless volleyball. I’ve heard the argument that talk of shame and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty; how we've all got one. Seen one, seen ’em all. But it’s not for me, beneath my double load of Calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies. For me, I have to see the clothes come off: the way a button’s thumbed through cotton cloth - a winning move in some exotic game with no set rules but countless permutations - or how a summer dress falls to the floor with momentary mass and with a plash that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion; a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip, three fingertips that follow down the spine to where a clasp is neatly spun undone amidkiss, by prime legerdemain and who cares that it happens once in four and never, never on the first undressing, it must be better than a foreskin snagged on gorse thorns or a cold, fat nipple jammed in the scissor drawer, the bounty and the blessing, the mystery of nakedness reduced till on a par with go-go palaces where goosebumped, grinding strippers strut their stuff in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses, down on a par with the oncologist who gropes for lumps, the night-morgue man who clips his nails amongst the naked, bin-bagged stiffs. So, stranger, what I want to say is this: if you’re to join me in a little sinning (and this is my place up here on the right), please understand I’d value some reluctance, a cold-feet shiver, as in the beginning when Eve discovered modesty and slipped in and out of something comfortable. For there are many ways to skin a cat, but ours is human nature - things come off so rarely. Come in. Let me take your coat.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Into perplexity: as an itch chased round an oxter or early man in the cave mouth watching rain-drifts pour from beyond his understanding. Whether to admire the mere sensation, enough, or hold out for sweeter ornament, vessels of wonder born with that ur-charm of symmetry; lovely ones we ache to prize and praise, climb into and become because they try our day-by-day significance: some of us ugly and most of us plain, walked past in the drowned streets: pearls of paste, salted butter, secondary colors. They drift unapproached, gazed never-selves, blunt paragons of genetic industry. We desire them but cannot want such order. We stand, mouths open, and cannot help stammering our secrets, nailed to water.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Just then, encountering my ruddy face in the grand piano's cold black craquelure, it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon dipping up over the roofs of the Tenderloin.

Kitten curious, or roaring down drinks in Soho sumps, small hours tour buses, satellite station green rooms, or conked out in the bathtubs of motorway hotels, there you were, with muck-about kisses, sharking for the snappers, before hell opened up for you and weeping sores of after fame appeared, the haphazardry and dwindling after three limelit years, recognized with catcalls, wads of spit, a nightclub fist, the scant camaraderie melts fast, like your flat on Air Street, the Lhasa Apso pups, the wraps and lines of chang, the poster pull-outs, fake tan smiles. It’s paunch and palimony time on Lucifer’s leash. But for a madcap few who cling, thin soup, one pillow Britain is simmering with hatred, just for you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tricky work sometimes not to smell yourself, ferment being constant—constant as carnival sweat (a non-stock phrase I palmed from a girl from Canada, a land where I once saw this graffiti: life is great). And I have tasted myself, especially when I spilled sinigang all down my arm in a Pinoy workers' caff in Little Manila. I drank sinigang (is soup drunk?) in Big Manila too, with all its dead skyscrapers. Seen myself? In looking glasses or, looking down, stocky as a shift working cop, maybe a Mexican cop full of beans (frijoles, I mean, not vim), paunch full of sopa de vigilia, pulling over a sozzled bus driver. Heard myself speak fluently in my own language, have heard myself too described as hard work (as hard to get through as Scotch broth), though once someone rather bladdered told me I was magnetic. And I may as well admit that I have touched myself (who hasn't?). In a forest, on a train, in New York and Paris with unparalleled handiwork, sinning as I go, merry as an office boy spooning onion soup.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Take this: for nothing here’s chiming, vibrating and all this vainglory and self-deprecating just goads at the tender parts, gets irritating. You’ll make no advance advocating monopoly on any vocabulary; even cacophony needs the needle to make its point properly. It’s true that you find yourself fey and bewitching, yet always you feel that the itch that you’re scratching’s soothed better by far by bravadoes of bitching. The off-pat flyting, back-biting and threnody you render and throw up, at will, won’t remedy the rot of your serenading, lute-laden wannabe. You can’t see a barrier without pushing through it; it’s a poor pearl of pathos you don’t disintuit and you now give a doing when once you’d just do it. You want my advice? Here it is: try removing the self from your argument - gluts of self-loving just pudding the gut of whatever you’re proving. That’s it on the chin and I’m sure you can take it, but that shadow you’re boxing is me, so please break it gently. Best wishes, I hope that you make it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
An inch from the curse and pearled by the evening heat I shake my polo neck and a cool draught buffs my chest. What rises is my animal aroma the scent of blue-ribbon stock the sort a starred chef would ladle from a zinc-bottomed pan to soften and savor the hock he has sawn and roasted for the diners out front who sip at shots of pastis and gnaw around the pits of kalamata olives. My head sits in his fridge: stooping for herb butter, our eyes meet and he touches my cotton-cold face just as once I stroked your cheek in a dream you suffered in a room above the river.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The kilted porter shook my hand in welcome, drained it of blood and gave me back my luggage. I signed the register in my own name for the first time in my life of low celebrity. In the lounge bar, there were pictures by Margarita but no sign of margaritas by the pitcher. All night, the couple in the next-door room failed noisily to make love even once. The signature tune of the air conditioning was a surface B-side for any one-hit-wonder. Weary, I ordered up the late night menu from room service, but sleep wasn’t on it so, after an hour of mentally undressing myself, I donned the pyjamas with the killer bee motif and there on the bed I wrote a dozen identical postcards to friends I’d forgotten. No doubt to keep the cold tap company, the hot tap had opted to be a cold tap too. Funnel-web spiders wove their lazy way toward each other across the scarlet ceiling and when I solved the riddle of the shower, no blood came gushing, but no water either. By the bed, a Gideon Bible in Esperanto and a phone-book listing Lumsdens of the world; in the mini-bar, flat Vimto and a half-pint of someone else’s mother’s milk, turned to fur. The TV had one channel, showing highlights from my worst performances in every sphere. At three, in the courtyard, a chambermaid choir sang a barbershop version of ‘I Will Survive’. The only time I dared to close my eyes, dervishes under the bed began to talk dirty. When I left at nine and settled my check, they told me clearly Don't come back.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The man I could have been works for a vital institution, is a vital institution. Without him, walls will crumble, somewhere, paint will peel. He takes a catch. He is outdoorsy and says It was a nightmare and means the traffic. He’s happy to watch a film and stops short of living in one.

He doesn’t lace up his life with secrets. The man I could have been was born on a high horse. He knows the story of the Willow Pattern. He had a dream last night you’d want to hear about and remembers the words to songs. His back is a saddle where lovers have ridden. The man I could have been has a sovereign speech in him he’s yet to give. He might well wrassle him a bear. He is a man about town. He has the exact fare on him. Without him, motley trauma.

Without him, salt water would enter your lungs. He doesn’t hear these endless xylophones. That’s not him lying over there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It doesn’t take the full-wind sickness, just the mere, the constant threat of it, just the salt trace, its faint knocking to bring the spirits of chance and chaos into this house - they stand in doorways: quaint, foul allies, swivelling their ghost hips, tugging at their gowns of transparency and mischief. They buzz me with lust, and I’m undone. Remember these: the Cupid who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed an arrow, one evening on Broughton Street; whatever grabbed my shoulder at Earlshall; a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down the empty hallway; the past is the self’s ghoul. What is it, Roddy, you know you’ve blocked out? What left your brain so empty that it gushed full with circus music and the safe bet of trivia? Here I am swinging on the fence of fences, in limbo, where the other world loves to try my pragmatism and it’s I who have invited them, summoned by this self-indulgent ouija. But what is it that folds my clothes as I sleep and leaves them on the edge of the bed? Who hides my slippers, re-hangs the paintings? Deja vu. Did a minor goddess filch me in Manila and follow me home, prone, as they are, to easy-led mortal men. And I’m easy, easy. So, come now, teach me to believe in the soul. Hurt me with the truth. Press me back down on this cheap, wine-coloured carpet; let me know for once and for all how fucked I am.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It’s like what my ancestor told me in a dream:You’ll be a sponge for the pain of others. It’s like what I told the lassie from the local paper:I do not suffer for my art, I just suffer. And face it, while we’re at it, it’s like what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti when all the gang were gathered for the show: how she reckoned I would be the first to die, or the time I slipped back from the bogs in Bo’s to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl who’d been sweet in my company, mind how you go with Roddy, he’s damaged goods, you know.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Lame again, I limp home along Lawn Terrace with a flowering sun star in a paper wrap then back to the village with a lame cat twisting and woeful in her cage. Bread these days isn't baked to last: how sad those posh loaves thudding off in pine breadbins all around the Heath: soulless latterday pets, frisky for a day or two, then binned or thrown to foxes, loaves just an inch of gloom below the caged birds you notice in corners of those same mansions when you seek the past, dinking their mirrors, dipping once in a while for a sip of milk.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
With refreshments and some modesty and home-drawn maps, the ladies of the parish are marshaling the plans in hand, devising the occasions, in softest pencil: the Day of Hearsay, Leeway Week, the Maybe Pageant, a hustings on the word nearby. Half-promised rain roosts in some clouds a mile out, gradual weather making gradual notes on the green, the well, the monument, the mayor's yard where dogs purr on elastic. Everything taken by the smooth handle then, or about to be, hiatus sharp in humble fashion. A small boy spins one wheel of an upturned bike, the pond rises, full of skimmed stones on somehow days, not Spring, not Summer yet. Engagements are announced in the Chronicle, a nine-yard putt falls short. Dark cattle amble on the angles of Flat Field. The ladies close their plotting books and fill pink teacups, there or thereabouts.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Skipping out from the major international cocktail partywith my becleavaged blight, a jeroboam in her tight fist,I broke open my copy of Sarcasm for Beginners, i.e., men.Never had I seen so many pairs of to-the-elbow gloves.Never did I see a puttoed ceiling groan so with thin talkas the great, the grim and the gone pressed terrible flesh,so many penguins offering tastesome wisps and skimpsfrom doilied salvers: cherry-shaded caviar, cheese puffs,dark sugared berries, dainty octopods, gently vinegared,with not enough tentacles to count the capes and stoles,fine bespoke pashminas, silk snoods, at least one vicuñasuit, tainted with gold thread. I’d seen down a Blenheim,two Lime Rickeys and was eyeing a gamine mixologistwho was straining out Savoy Royales when my raddlednemesis limped over to announce she had encounteredmy latest screed, all four foot eleven of her tortoiseishlyquivering, a nubbin of cream cheese on her whiskery lipand her good eye withering my borrowed companionetteas she leaned on air. I am not a man who has not knownthe turmoil women offer, the gift you accept of their wit,the way you’d slip a hand into a gloveful of cockroaches,comply with a last-minute call to join a seal cull. Tanya,I pouted, I am awed and honored you opened a windowin your schedule even to glance at my inconsequentialoutpourings. At which point she clattered out a scoffinggibe so sour you couldn’t blend it with a chemistry setfrom Hamley’s and, seizing my escort by her neat wrist,we tore out onto Jermyn Street, along which I performeda sort of shuffle, one eye on the book and one on m’lady’scompetition-standard backside as she led us to the Ritz.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
For once, I felt wanted, dead or alive, the day my fame outgrew the Famous Five. There came a time I could give no more to the other guys in the Gang of Four and I felt the dead weight fall from me when I unyoked the clowns of the Crucial Three. I considered all this as I boarded the bus to quit the town not big enough for both of us. One eye didn’t seem so much to leave behind as I sped to my job in the kingdom of the blind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I hurt you and cast you off, that was buccaneer work: the sky must have turned on the Bay that day and spat. We’d tarried on corners, we’d dallied on sofas, we were in progress, do you see? Yet stormcloud bruises bloomed where once we touched. The walls swam under minty fever; we failed to reach the long, low sleep of conquerors. Since I played wrong and you did too, since we were wrong, we need apologies; for your part in this sorry slip of hearts, you should walk on Golden Hill at night alone; for mine I will hang with my enemies, out on the long shore, our brigand bodies impaled on the horns of our failures, the cold day casting draughts through our brinkled bones.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

For the first time, I listen to a lost and secret recording of us making love near-on ten years ago. I recognize your voice, your sounds, though if I knew no better, I could be any man in any room. After, the rising sounds of rising and of dressing and once as you step up close to the deck, perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing the chorus of Sunday Morning. I call on you to hurry and we leave. It does not end then; the tape rolls on. A few late cars which sigh by might have passed us walking away triumphant, unaware we’ve left behind this mop and mow mechanism of silence to which we may never return.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

You bastards! It’s all sherbet, and folly makes you laugh like mules. Chances dance off your wrists, each day ready, sprites in your bones and spite not yet swollen, not yet set. You gather handful after miracle handful, seeing straight, reaching the lighthouse in record time, pockets brim with scimitar things. Now is not a pinpoint but a sprawling realm. Bewilderment and thrill are whip-quick twins, carried on your backs, each vow new to touch and each mistake a broken biscuit. I was you. Sea robber boarding the won galleon. Roaring trees. Machines without levers, easy in bowel and lung. One cartwheel over the quicksand curve of Tuesday to Tuesday and you’re gone, summering, a ship on the farthest wave.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The star dissolved in evening—the one star The silently and night O soon now, soon And still the light now and still now the large Relinquishing and through the pools of blue Still, still the swallows and a wind now and the tree Gathering darkness: I was small. I lay Beside my mother on the grass, and sleep Came— slow hooves and dripping with the dark The velvet muzzles, the white feet that move In a dream water and O soon now soon Sleep and the night. And I was not afraid. Her hand lay over mine. Her fingers knew Darkness,—and sleep—the silent lands, the far Far off of morning where I should awake.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A poem should be palpable and mute As a globed fruit, Dumb As old medallions to the thumb, Silent as the sleeve-worn stone Of casement ledges where the moss has grown— A poem should be wordless As the flight of birds. * A poem should be motionless in time As the moon climbs, Leaving, as the moon releases Twig by twig the night-entangled trees, Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves, Memory by memory the mind— A poem should be motionless in time As the moon climbs. * A poem should be equal to: Not true. For all the history of grief An empty doorway and a maple leaf. For love The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea— A poem should not mean But be.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
First there is the wind but not like the familiar wind but long and without lapses or falling away or surges of air as is usual but rather like the persistent pressure of a river or a running tide. This wind is from the other side and has an odor unlike the odor of the winds with us but like time if time had odor and were cold and carried a bitter and sharp taste like rust on the taste of snow or the fragrance of thunder. When the air has this taste of time the frontiers are not far from us. Then too there are the animals. There are always animals under the small trees. They belong neither to our side nor to theirs but are wild and because they are animals of such kind that wildness is unfamiliar in them as the horse for example or the goat and often sheep and dogs and like creatures their wandering there is strange and even terrifying signaling as it does the violation of custom and the subversion of order. There are also the unnatural lovers the distortion of images the penetration of mirrors and the inarticulate meanings of the dreams. The dreams are in turmoil like a squall of birds. Finally there is the evasion of those with whom we have come. It is at the frontiers that the companions desert us—that the girl returns to the old country that we are alone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
(1) Our epoch takes a voluptuous satisfaction In that perspective of the action Which pictures us inhabiting the end Of everything with death for only friend. Not that we love death, Not truly, not the fluttering breath, The obscene shudder of the finished act— What the doe feels when the ultimate fact Tears at her bowels with its jaws. Our taste is for the opulent pause Before the end comes. If the end is certain All of us are players at the final curtain: All of us, silence for a time deferred, Find time before us for one sad last word. Victim, rebel, convert, stoic— Every role but the heroic— We turn our tragic faces to the stalls To wince our moment till the curtain falls. (2) A world ends when its metaphor has died. An age becomes an age, all else beside, When sensuous poets in their pride invent Emblems for the soul’s consent That speak the meanings men will never know But man-imagined images can show: It perishes when those images, though seen, No longer mean. (3) A world was ended when the womb Where girl held God became the tomb Where God lies buried in a man: Botticelli’s image neither speaks nor can To our kind. His star-guided stranger Teaches no longer, by the child, the manger, The meaning of the beckoning skies. Sophocles, when his reverent actors rise To play the king with bleeding eyes, No longer shows us on the stage advance God’s purpose in the terrible fatality of chance. No woman living, when the girl and swan Embrace in verses, feels upon Her breast the awful thunder of that breast Where God, made beast, is by the blood confessed. Empty as conch shell by the waters cast The metaphor still sounds but cannot tell, And we, like parasite crabs, put on the shell And drag it at the sea’s edge up and down. This is the destiny we say we own. (4) But are we sure The age that dies upon its metaphor Among these Roman heads, these mediaeval towers, Is ours?— Or ours the ending of that story? The meanings in a man that quarry Images from blinded eyes And white birds and the turning skies To make a world of were not spent with these Abandoned presences. The journey of our history has not ceased: Earth turns us still toward the rising east, The metaphor still struggles in the stone, The allegory of the flesh and bone Still stares into the summer grass That is its glass, The ignorant blood Still knocks at silence to be understood. Poets, deserted by the world before, Turn round into the actual air: Invent the age! Invent the metaphor!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I speak this poem now with grave and level voice In praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall. I praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall Unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise. I praise the fall: it is the human season. Now No more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth, Enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth, Nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough, But now in autumn with the black and outcast crows Share we the spacious world: the whispering year is gone: There is more room to live now: the once secret dawn Comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes. Between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves And winter’s covering of our hearts with his deep snow We are alone: there are no evening birds: we know The naked moon: the tame stars circle at our eaves. It is the human season. On this sterile air Do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and on. I hear a dead man’s cry from autumn long since gone. I cry to you beyond upon this bitter air.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Señora, it is true the Greeks are dead. It is true also that we here are Americans: That we use the machines: that a sight of the god is unusual: That more people have more thoughts: that there are Progress and science and tractors and revolutions and Marx and the wars more antiseptic and murderous And music in every home: there is also Hoover. Does the lady suggest we should write it out in The Word? Does Madame recall our responsibilities? We are Whores, Fräulein: poets, Fräulein, are persons of Known vocation following troops: they must sleep with Stragglers from either prince and of both views. The rules permit them to further the business of neither. It is also strictly forbidden to mix in maneuvers. Those that infringe are inflated with praise on the plazas— Their bones are resultantly afterwards found under newspapers. Preferring life with the sons to death with the fathers, We also doubt on the record whether the sons Will still be shouting around with the same huzzas— For we hope Lady to live to lie with the youngest. There are only a handful of things a man likes, Generation to generation, hungry or Well fed: the earth’s one: life’s One: Mister Morgan is not one. There is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style. He that goes naked goes further at last than another. Wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they’ll jimmy his Door down and be thick in his bed—for a month: (Who recalls the address now of the Imagists?) But the naked man has always his own nakedness. People remember forever his live limbs. They may drive him out of the camps but one will take him. They may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope’s argument— He will lie in a house and be warm when they are shaking. Besides, Tovarishch, how to embrace an army? How to take to one’s chamber a million souls? How to conceive in the name of a column of marchers? The things of the poet are done to a man alone As the things of love are done—or of death when he hears the Step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick only. Neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near him There where he lies on his left arm and will die, Nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is jeering And his knee’s in the soft of the bed where his love lies. I remind you, Barinya, the life of the poet is hard— A hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver: Is it just to demand of us also to bear arms?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

These alternate nights and days, these seasons Somehow fail to convince me. It seems I have the sense of infinity! (In your dreams, O crew of Columbus, O listeners over the sea For the surf that breaks upon Nothing—) Once I was waked by the nightingales in the garden. I thought, What time is it? I thought, Time—Is it Time still?—Now is it Time? (Tell me your dreams, O sailors: Tell me, in sleep did you climb The tall masts, and before you—) At night the stillness of old trees Is a leaning over and the inertness Of hills is a kind of waiting. (In sleep, in a dream, did you see The world’s end? Did the water Break—and no shore—Did you see?) Strange faces come through the streets to me Like messengers: and I have been warned By the moving slowly of hands at a window. Oh, I have the sense of infinity— But the world, sailors, is round. They say there is no end to it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Think of our blindness where the water burned! Are we so certain that those wings, returned And turning, we had half discerned Before our dazzled eyes had surely seen The bird aloft there, did not mean?— Our hearts so seized upon the sign! Think how we sailed up-wind, the brine Tasting of daphne, the enormous wave Thundering in the water cave— Thunder in stone. And how we beached the skiff And climbed the coral of that iron cliff And found what only in our hearts we’d heard— The silver screaming of that one, white bird: The fabulous wings, the crimson beak That opened, red as blood, to shriek And clamor in that world of stone, No voice to answer but its own. What certainty, hidden in our hearts before, Found in the bird its metaphor?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You, my friends, and you strangers, all of you, Stand with me a little by the walls Or where the walls once were. The bridge was here, the city further: Now there is neither bridge nor town— A doorway where the roof is down Opens on a foot-worn stair That climbs by three steps into empty air. (What foot went there?) Nothing in this town that had a thousand steeples Lives now but these flocks of sheep Grazing the yellow grasses where the bricks lie dead beneath: Dogs drive them with their brutal teeth. Can none but sheep live where the walls go under? Is man’s day over and the sheep’s begun? And shall we sit here like the mourners on a dunghill Shrilling with melodious tongue— Disfiguring our faces with the nails of our despair? (What dust is this we sift upon our hair?) Because a world is taken from us as the camels from the man of Uz Shall we sit weeping for the world that was And curse God and so perish? Shall monuments be grass and sheep inherit them? Shall dogs rule in the rubble of the arches? Consider, Oh consider what we are! Consider what it is to be a man— He who makes his journey by the glimmer of a candle; Who discovers in his mouth, between his teeth, a word; Whose heart can bear the silence of the stars— that burden; Who comes upon his meaning in the blindness of a stone— A girl’s shoulder, perfectly harmonious! Even the talk of it would take us days together. Marvels men have made, Oh marvels!—and our breath Brief as it is: our death waiting— Marvels upon marvels! Works of state— The imagination of the shape of order! Works of beauty—the cedar door Perfectly fitted to the sill of basalt! Works of grace— The ceremony at the entering of houses, At the entering of lives: the bride among the torches in the shrill carouse! Works of soul— Pilgrimages through the desert to the sacred boulder: Through the mid night to the stroke of one! Works of grace! Works of wonder! All this have we done and more— And seen—what have we not seen?— A man beneath the sunlight in his meaning: A man, one man, a man alone. In the sinks of the earth that wanderer has gone down. The shadow of his mind is on the mountains. The word he has said is kept in the place beyond As the seed is kept and the earth ponders it. Stones—even the stones remember him: Even the leaves—his image is in them. And now because the city is a ruin in the waste of air We sit here and despair! Because the sheep graze in the dying grove Our day is over! We must end Because the talk around the table in the dusk has ended, Because the fingers of the goddesses are found Like marble pebbles in the gravelly ground And nothing answers but the jackal in the desert,— Because the cloud proposes, the wind says! Because the sheep are pastured where the staring statues lie We sit upon the sand in silence Watching the sun go and the shadows change! Listen, my friends, and you, all of you, strangers, Listen, the work of man, the work of splendor Never has been ended or will end. Even where the sheep defile the ruined stair And dogs are masters—even there One man’s finger in the dust shall trace the circle. Even among the ruins shall begin the work, Large in the level morning of the light And beautiful with cisterns where the water whitens, Rippling upon the lip of stone, and spills By cedar sluices into pools, and the young builders String their plumb lines, and the well-laid course Blanches its mortar in the sun, and all the morning Smells of wood-smoke, rope-tar, horse-sweat, pitch-pine, Men and the trampled mint leaves in the ditch. One man in the sun alone Walks between the silence and the stone: The city rises from his flesh, his bone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Well yes, I said, my mother wears a dot. I know they said \"third eye\" in class, but it's not an eye eye, not like that.

From golden showers of the ancient skies, On the first day, and the eternal snow of stars, You once unfastened giant calyxes For the young earth still innocent of scars: Young gladioli with the necks of swans, Laurels divine, of exiled souls the dream, Vermilion as the modesty of dawns Trod by the footsteps of the seraphim; The hyacinth, the myrtle gleaming bright, And, like the flesh of woman, the cruel rose, Hérodiade blooming in the garden light, She that from wild and radiant blood arose! And made the sobbing whiteness of the lily That skims a sea of sighs, and as it wends Through the blue incense of horizons, palely Toward the weeping moon in dreams ascends! Hosanna on the lute and in the censers, Lady, and of our purgatorial groves! Through heavenly evenings let the echoes answer, Sparkling haloes, glances of rapturous love! Mother, who in your strong and righteous bosom, Formed calyxes balancing the future flask, Capacious flowers with the deadly balsam For the weary poet withering on the husk.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. ANCIENT OVERTURE OF HÉ﻿RODIADE The Nurse (Incantation) Abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears Of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears, The naked golds lashing the crimson space, An Aurora—heraldic plumage—has chosen to embrace Our cinerary tower of sacrifice, Heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice Of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes… Ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes! No splashing! the gloomy water, standing still, No longer visited by snowy quill Or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving Of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving, Of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb Of its feathers, it buried its head, undone By the pure diamond of a star, but one Of long ago, which never even shone. Crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre! Empurpled sky, complicit in the mire, And stained-glass windows opening red on carnage. The strange chamber, framed in all the baggage Of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint, Has yesteryear’s snows instead of its ancient tint; And its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases With the buried eyes of prophetesses Offering Magi withered fingers. One, With floral past enwoven on my gown Bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky Bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery Of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen, An aroma, roses, rising from the hidden Couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds, An aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds, A drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon (Though the taper’s quenched, petals still fall from one), Flowers whose long regrets and stems appear Drenched in a lonely vase to languish there… An Aurora dragged her wings in the basin’s tears! Magical shadow with symbolic powers! A voice from the distant past, an evocation, Is it not mine prepared for incantation? In the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed, Lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed, Spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold, Through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds Pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud Through which the old veiled brightness is allowed To mount, in desperation, shall arise (But oh, the distance hidden in those cries!) The old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver, Of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar: Will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor, And, in the hour of its agony, render Itself as the anthem for psalms of petition? For all are alike in being brought to perdition By the power of old silence and deepening gloom, Fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone, Like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond. Sometimes she sang an incoherent song. Lamentable sign! the bed of vellum sheets, Useless and closed–not linen!—vainly waits, Bereft now of the cherished grammary That spelled the figured folds of reverie, The silken tent that harbored memory, The fragrance of sleeping hair. Were these its treasure? Cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure, Shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn, Or when the pomegranate’s flesh is torn By wicked night! Alone, the crescent moon On the iron clockface is a pendulum Suspending Lucifer: the clepsydra pours Dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours As, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade On undeciphered paths without a guide! All this the king knows not, whose salary Has fed so long this agèd breast now dry. Her father knows it no more than the cruel Glacier mirroring his arms of steel, When sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins Smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens With dark silver trumpets the ancient pines! Will he ever come back from the Cisalpines? Soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding! On the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according To the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns, And to an envious candle it turns A finger. And soon, when the sad sun sinks, It shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks! No sunset, but the red awakening Of the last day concluding everything Struggles so sadly that time disappears, The redness of apocalypse, whose tears Fall@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me. I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements. My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The builder who first bridged Niagara’s gorge, Before he swung his cable, shore to shore, Sent out across the gulf his venturing kite Bearing a slender cord for unseen hands To grasp upon the further cliff and draw A greater cord, and then a greater yet; Till at the last across the chasm swung The cable then the mighty bridge in air! So we may send our little timid thought Across the void, out to God’s reaching hands— Send out our love and faith to thread the deep— Thought after thought until the little cord Has greatened to a chain no chance can break, And we are anchored to the Infinite!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We are circling, glad of the battle: we joy in the smell of the smoke. Fight on in the hell of the trenches: we publish your names with a croak! Ye will lie in dim heaps when the sunset blows cold on the reddening sand; Yet fight, for the dead will have wages—a death-clutch of dust in the hand. Ye have given us banquet, O kings, and still do we clamor for more: Vast, vast is our hunger, as vast as the sea-hunger gnawing the shore. ’Tis well ye are swift with your signals— the blaze of the banners, the blare Of the bugles, the boom of battalions, the cannon-breath hot on the air. It is for our hunger ye hurry, it is for our feast ye are met: Be sure we will never forget you, O servants that never forget! For we are the Spirits of Battle, the peerage of greed we defend: Our lineage rose from the Night, and we go without fellow or friend. We were ere our servant Sesostris spread over the Asian lands The smoke of the blood of the peoples, and scattered their bones to the sands. We circled in revel for ages above the Assyrian stream, While Babylon builded her beauty, and faded to dust and to dream. We scattered our laughter on nations— and Troy was a word and a waste, The glory of Carthage was ruined, the grandeur of Rome was effaced! And we blazoned the name of Timour, as he harried his herd of kings, And the host of his hordes wound on, a dragon with undulant rings. And we slid down the wind upon France, when the steps of the earthquake passed, When the Bastile bloomed into flame, and the heavens went by on the blast. We hung over Austerlitz, cheering the armies with jubilant cries: We scented three kings at the carnage, and croaked our applause from the skies. O kings, ye have catered to vultures— have chosen to feed us, forsooth, The joy of the world and her glory, the hope of the world and her youth. O kings, ye are diligent lackeys: we laurel your names with our praise, For ye are the staff of our comfort, for ye are the strength of our days. Then spur on the host in the trenches to give up the sky at a stroke: We tell all the winds of their glory: we publish their fame with a croak!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The twilight is the morning of his day. While Sleep drops seaward from the fading shore, With purpling sail and dip of silver oar, He cheers the shadowed time with roundelay, Until the dark east softens into gray. Now as the noisy hours are coming—hark! His song dies gently—it is growing dark— His night, with its one star, is on the way! Faintly the light breaks over the blowing oats— Sleep, little brother, sleep: I am astir. We worship Song, and servants are of her— I in the bright hours, thou in shadow-time: Lead thou the starlit night with merry notes, And I will lead the clamoring day with rhyme.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I would my soul were like the bird That dares the vastness undeterred. Look, where the bluebird on the bough Breaks into rapture even now! He sings, tip-top, the tossing elm As tho he would a world o’erwhelm. Indifferent to the void he rides Upon the wind’s eternal tides. He tosses gladly on the gale, For well he knows he can not fail— Knows if the bough breaks, still his wings Will bear him upward while he sings!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There came gray stretches of volcanic plains, Bare, lone and treeless, then a bleak lone hill Like to the dolorous hill that Dobell saw. Around were heaps of ruins piled between The Burn o’ Sorrow and the Water o’ Care; And from the stillness of the down-crushed walls One pillar rose up dark against the moon. There was a nameless Presence everywhere; In the gray soil there was a purple stain, And the gray reticent rocks were dyed with blood— Blood of a vast unknown Calamity. It was the mark of some ancestral grief— Grief that began before the ancient Flood.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour Greatening and darkening as it hurried on, She left the Heaven of Heroes and came down To make a man to meet the mortal need. She took the tried clay of the common road— Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth, Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy; Tempered the heap with thrill of human tears; Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff. Into the shape she breathed a flame to light That tender, tragic, ever-changing face. Here was a man to hold against the world, A man to match the mountains and the sea. The color of the ground was in him, the red earth; The smack and tang of elemental things; The rectitude and patience of the cliff; The good-will of the rain that loves all leaves; The friendly welcome of the wayside well; The courage of the bird that dares the sea; The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn; The pity of the snow that hides all scars; The secrecy of streams that make their way Beneath the mountain to the rifted rock; The tolerance and equity of light That gives as freely to the shrinking flower As to the great oak flaring to the wind— To the grave’s low hill as to the Matterhorn That shoulders out the sky. Sprung from the West, He drank the valorous youth of a new world. The strength of virgin forests braced his mind, The hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul. His words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts Were roots that firmly gripped the granite truth. Up from log cabin to the Capitol, One fire was on his spirit, one resolve— To send the keen ax to the root of wrong, Clearing a free way for the feet of God, The eyes of conscience testing every stroke, To make his deed the measure of a man. He built the rail-pile as he built the State, Pouring his splendid strength through every blow: The grip that swung the ax in Illinois Was on the pen that set a people free. So came the Captain with the mighty heart; And when the judgment thunders split the house, Wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest, He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again The rafters of the Home. He held his place— Held the long purpose like a growing tree— Held on through blame and faltered not at praise. And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down As when a lordly cedar, green with boughs, Goes down with a great shout upon the hills, And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Alone I list In the leafy tryst; Silent the woodlands in their starry sleep— Silent the phantom wood in waters deep: No footfall of a wind along the pass Startles a harebell—stirs a blade of grass. Yonder the wandering weeds, Enchanted in the light, Stand in the gusty hollows, still and white; Yonder are plumy reeds, Dusking the border of the clear lagoon; Far off the silver clifts Hang in ethereal light below the moon; Far off the ocean lifts, Tossing its billows in the misty beam, And shore-lines whiten, silent as a dream: I hark for the bird, and all the hushed hills harken: This is the valley: here the branches darken The silver-lighted stream. Hark— That rapture in the leafy dark! Who is it shouts upon the bough aswing, Waking the upland and the valley under? What carols, like the blazon of a king, Fill all the dawn with wonder? Oh, hush, It is the thrush, In the deep and woody glen! Ah, thus the gladness of the gods was sung, When the old Earth was young; That rapture rang, When the first morning on the mountains sprang: And now he shouts, and the world is young again! Carol, my king, On your bough aswing! Thou art not of these evil days— Thou art a voice of the world’s lost youth: Oh, tell me what is duty—what is truth— How to find God upon these hungry ways; Tell of the golden prime, When bird and beast could make a man their friend ; When men beheld swift deities descend, Before the race was left alone with Time, Homesick on Earth, and homeless to the end; Before great Pan was dead, Before the naiads fled; When maidens white with dark eyes shy and bold, With peals of laughter on the peaks of gold, Startled the still dawn— Shone in upon the mountains and were gone, Their voices fading silverly in depths of forests old. Sing of the wonders of their woodland ways, Before the weird earth-hunger of these days, When there was rippling mirth, When justice was on Earth, And light and grandeur of the Golden Age; When never a heart was sad, When all from king to herdsman had A penny for a wage. Ah, that old time has faded to a dream— The moon’s fair face is broken in the stream; Yet shout and carol on, O bird, and let The exiled race not utterly forget; Publish thy revelation on the lawns— Sing ever in the dark ethereal dawns; Sometime, in some sweet year, These stormy souls, these men of Earth may hear. But hark again, From the secret glen, That voice of rapture and ethereal youth Now laden with despair. Forbear, O bird, forbear: Is life not terrible enough forsooth? Cease, cease the mystic song— No more, no more, the passion and the pain: It wakes my life to fret against the chain; It makes me think of all the agéd wrong— Of joy and the end of joy and the end of all— Of souls on Earth, and souls beyond recall. Ah, ah, that voice again! It makes me think of all these restless men Called into time—their progress and their goal; And now, oh now, it sends into my soul Dreams of a love that might have been for me— That might have been—and now can never be. Tell me no more of these— Tell me of trancéd trees; (The ghosts, the memories, in pity spare) Show me the leafy home of the wild bees; Show me the snowy summits dim in air; Tell me of things afar In valleys silent under moon and star: Dim hollows hushed with night, The lofty cedars misty in the light, Wild clusters of the vine, Wild odors of the pine, The eagle’s eyrie lifted to the moon— High places where on quiet afternoon A shadow swiftens by, a thrilling scream Startles the cliff, and dies across the woodland to a dream. Ha, now He springs from the bough, It flickers—he is lost! Out of the copse he sprang; This is the floating briar where he tossed: The leaves are yet atremble where he sang Here a long vista opens—look! This is the way he took, Through the pale poplars by the pond: Hark! he is shouting in the field beyond. Ho, there he goes Through the alder close! He leaves me here behind him in his flight, And yet my heart goes with him out of sight! What whispered spell Of Faëry calls me on from dell to dell? I hear the@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground, The emptiness of ages in his face, And on his back the burden of the world. Who made him dead to rapture and despair, A thing that grieves not and that never hopes, Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox? Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw? Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow? Whose breath blew out the light within this brain? Is this the Thing the Lord God made and gave To have dominion over sea and land; To trace the stars and search the heavens for power; To feel the passion of Eternity? Is this the Dream He dreamed who shaped the suns And marked their ways upon the ancient deep? Down all the stretch of Hell to its last gulf There is no shape more terrible than this— More tongued with censure of the world’s blind greed— More filled with signs and portents for the soul— More fraught with danger to the universe. What gulfs between him and the seraphim! Slave of the wheel of labor, what to him Are Plato and the swing of Pleiades? What the long reaches of the peaks of song, The rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose? Through this dread shape the suffering ages look; Time’s tragedy is in that aching stoop; Through this dread shape humanity betrayed, Plundered, profaned and disinherited, Cries protest to the Judges of the World, A protest that is also prophecy. O masters, lords and rulers in all lands, is this the handiwork you give to God, This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched ? How will you ever straighten up this shape; Touch it again with immortality; Give back the upward looking and the light; Rebuild in it the music and the dream; Make right the immemorial infamies, Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes? O masters, lords and rulers in all lands, How will the Future reckon with this Man? How answer his brute question in that hour When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world? How will it be with kingdoms and with kings— With those who shaped him to the thing he is— When this dumb Terror shall reply to God After the silence of the centuries?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A host of poppies, a flight of swallows; A flurry of rain, and a wind that follows Shepherds the leaves in the sheltered hollows For the forest is shaken and thinned. Over my head are the firs for rafter; The crows blow south, and my heart goes after; I kiss my hands to the world with laughter— Is it Aidenn or mystical Ind? Oh, the whirl of the fields in the windy weather! How the barley breaks and blows together! Oh, glad is the free bird afloat on the heather— Oh, the whole world is glad of the wind!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The moon shears up on Tahoe now: A panther leaps to a tamarack bough. She crouches, hugging the crooked limb: She hears the nearing steps of him Who sent the little puff of smoke That stretched her mate beneath the oak. Her eyes burn beryl, two yellow balls, As Fate counts out his last footfalls. A sudden spring, a demon cry, Carnivorous laughter to the sky. Her teeth are fastened in his throat (The moon rides in her silver boat.) And now one scream of long delight Across the caverns of the night!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Once Phidias stood, with hammer in his hand, Carving Minerva from the breathing stone, Tracing with love the winding of a hair, A single hair upon her head, whereon A youth of Athens cried, “O Phidias, Why do you dally on a hidden hair? When she is lifted to the lofty front Of the Parthenon, no human eye will see.” And Phidias thundered on him: “Silence, slave: Men will not see, but the Immortals will!”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Long after the sun falls into the sea and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet and the air gets soaked in blackness; long after clouds hover above like boulders and stars crawl up and stud the sky; long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter and fatigue blows in and bends them and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them, a girl unlatches a window, walks shoeless into a forest, her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness. She walks into woods, her feet light-stepping through puddles, over hard packed dirt, through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled over lakes and frigid streams through dim cobbled streets darkened squares and dusty pastures. She runs from nothing, runs to nothing, beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings. In the dark the eyes of startled creatures gleam like a herd of candles. They scatter and give night its meaning. What echo of a bell lulled her what spirit, what scent of a word whose storm wrote her what banks fell to drown her which blood star which thread of water which trickle of light whose heart being launched whose floating soul seduced her what promise did it make her whose memory burned her whose prayer did she run to answer whose help, what sorrow clot what pain dammed inside her what wall must she rebuild now whose treasure beckons her who spread ivy like a veil to blind her? Daybreak lies chained to a blue wall from which the stars drop and lose all meaning. She runs past villages that lost their names roads that lost their destinations seas that lost their compasses and sailors rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers houses that lost their sleepers and criers trees that lost their songs and shadows gardens that lost their violets and benches valleys that lost their worms and farmers mountains that lost their prophets and marauders temples that lost their sinners and spires lightning that lost its silver and wires chimeras that lost their bridges minotaurs that lost their fountains. Crescent moons hover above her, ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless lost to their own meaning. Music rises out of her vision. It stands, a wall covered with silver mosses. A clarinet sounds a wounded mare, violins women who lost their children. Flutes blow their hot dry breezes. Drums chuckle the earth’s ceaseless laughter. Pianos are mumbling sorcerers calling spirits and powers. Cellos chew on the sounds of thunder. Dulcimers skip about on crutches. Dance floors flash their knives daring their dancers. Words mill about the streets like orphans. Then a lute begins groaning and dawn loses its meaning. Night girl, night girl your book is full now. You have drawn all the pictures. You have seen many weepers. Stars held your sky in place and moons floated on your lakes and washed them. When a bird sings when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes when curtains are soaked with light when mirrors drown in shadows, take your day to the shore, my child. Put out the words that fired your waking, scatter them on the sand like seeds, then with your feet gently tap them, and let the bright waves receive your meaning.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He started out making feluccas; an Egyptian taught him how. Then he opened a shop by the beach, sold ice cream, parasols and chairs. He asked for my hand when I was in teacher college, first year. Time passes like the Ghibli here. I was 7 months with my third baby when someone sought him for a Zodiac. He traveled all the way to Guangzhou, brought back a dozen, has been selling them ever since. One night I asked how strong they were, how many they carry. “It’s all in the booklet,” he said, “no reason for what keeps happening to them.” He sipped from a glass of bokha and explained how from this same jetty, long before the Arabs and Vandals, even before the Romans and their famous theater, boats filled with people and goods and sailed off. A day or a week later, the sea sends back the drowned. His long-lashed eyes closed when he spoke, his face unchanged by the years. His fingers moved so carefully putting out his cigarette. He saw me looking, nodded, then pulled me toward his manhood to help him sleep.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Today the date palms were pruned, the branches taken before the fruit ripened, before sweetness littered the sidewalks. The man who sawed them worked alone, a crane lifting him to the yellowed fronds. Beside his truck, he stood tall, American, a pensive pioneer. The top of each palm looked like the back of a man's head after a close-crop haircut, the neck cooled to a stubbly remembrance of hair, or was like a cat after being spayed, startled by a strange newness, pacing familiar rooms, darting, confused, and you (had you wished to console) are greeted with a barren gaze. The rubble of bark and fronds reminded me of Iraq, not the ruined bridges, or the surrendering soldiers' hands begging food, but the 16 million date palms, one per capita, lining the seams of the Tigris and Euphrates, a reminder of my own Libya and its 10 million date palms and the years of easy wealth that brought them neglect except in Huun, a magical city where they stuffed dates with almonds and sent them as far as Tanta and Oum Dourman. From Huun this story: a boy stands by a palm imploring his uncle to toss him a fistful of dates. Flustered by the boy's monotonous cries the uncle loses his feet, and as he falls to his death, cries down \"Here nephew, I'm coming down with the dates!\" So that's what we got from Huun, almond stuffed wonders and proverbial last words. There was another reminder, a tale of the prophet Muhammad living for months on water and coarse wheat bread, his wives protesting the austere measures of his faith. Muhammad, who praised honey and had a professed love for cantaloupes, and who once declared \"the best meat is that which lines the bones,\" found in dates the solution he required. To his Arab followers, and to his wives, the fruit was \"three skies above luxury,\" and as indispensable as water and air. I once had this dream of Whitman: I found him under one of the palms on Sherman Way gazing admiring. Though he had seen palms by the Gulf of Mexico, he had never tasted a date. So we drove to a supermarket, and he who had been thoughtful, even dignified, until then, began to sign and moan at the taste of \"Araby's sugared dust clouds.\" When we walked the aisles he insisted on pushing the cart. The frozen foods did not surprise him since his Granny buried potatoes in the cold dirt of her homestead. Still I had to explain tofu, plastic, tacos, and the foods labeled free. He ran his hands caressing the waxed floor; \"Smooth as a girl's wrist,\" he exclaimed. The bright fluorescent lights reminded hirn of the opera, and Walt sang a gravelly tune. The children sitting in carts reached for him, their hands were Lorca's butterflies on his beard. At the cashier he filled pockets with candy, and was shocked by the headlines of our news. Honda, Toyota, Saturn, Oldsmobile— in the parking lot the names waltzed on his tongue. At the fast food stand he ate heartily, the burger's slipperiness amused him, and at his clumsiness we both had a laugh. Then the talk grew quiet, the table stretching like the expanse of time dividing us; I felt he no longer wanted company, having begun to understand our world. Despite his old resentment of Blacks, and now my neighbors, the foreign-born Hispanics and their engines roaring through Balboa and Saticoy, and the Koreans' karoake— the baseline's muffled thuds, voices doused in Canadian Mist, and the off-key pleadings to the lover who never comes—, America remained to him luminous-industrial-fuming- sublime, and as he wished, beyond others' adjectives, beyond what anyone could have conceived. Mumbling a farewell, Whitman stood to leave. And with this my dream ended, Whitman wishing to depart and I holding on to his wrists. All day I wanted to hold his wide wrists. If you drive west of Alexandria your path will run through Alamain, Barani, and Matrouh. Then Egypt will end with a town on a steep hill called Sallum. If you go through the two checkpoints, Libya will unfold its dry pastures for you.

Cairo’s taxi drivers speak to me in English. I answer, and they say your Arabic is good. How long have you been with us? All my life I tell them, but I’m never believed. They speak to me in Farsi, speak to me in Greek, and I answer with mountains of gold and silver, ghost ships sailing the weed-choked seas. And when they speak to me in Spanish, I say Moriscos and Alhambra. I say Jews rescued by Ottoman boats. And when the speak to me in Portuguese, all my life I tell them, coffee, cocoa, Indians and poisoned spears. I say Afonsso king of Bikongo writing Manuel to free his enslaved sons. And Cairo’s taxi drivers tell me your Arabic is surprisingly good. Then they speak to me in Italian, and I tell them how I lay swaddled a month’s walk from here. I tell them camps in the desert, barbed wire, wives and daughters dying, camels frothing disease, the sand stretching an endless pool. And they say so good so good. How long have you been with us? All my life, but I’m never believed. Then they speak to me in French, and I answer Jamila, Leopold, Stanley, baskets of severed hands and feet. I say the horror, battles of Algiers. And they speak to me in English and I say Lucknow, Arbenz. I say indigo, Hiroshima, continents soaked in tea. I play the drum beat of stamps. I invoke Mrs. Cummings, U.S. consul in Athens, I say Ishi, Custer, Wounded Knee. And Cairo's taxi drivers tell me your Arabic is unbelievably good. Tell the truth now, tell the truth, how long have you been with us? I say my first name is little lion, my last name is broken branch. I sing \"Happiness uncontainable\" and \"field greening in March\" until I'm sad and tired of truth, and as usual I'm never believed. Then they lead me through congestion, gritty air, narrow streets crowded with Pepsi and Daewoo and the sunken faces of the poor. And when we arrive, Cairo's taxi drivers and I speak all the languages of the world, and we argue and argue about corruption, disillusionment, the missed chances, the wicked binds, the cataclysmic fares.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We come to the city; we embrace the pantheon, but they dream of their one and only god. They want to be villagers again. Just when you began to distinguish the sound of your history from its echo, they want to be villagers again. You must not kill their sacred animal; you must give up your taboo for theirs for they want to be villagers again. Sunlight and shadow is what made this rose, you say, a god who could not have arisen elsewhere but they want to be villagers again. The twist in your tongue is the river’s song. It’s how your feet walk now, how your fingers strum, but they want to be villagers again. The dusk of their coffee, their muddy water booze, the herb of life shooting out of the impeccable concrete, but they want to be villagers again. You point to salt escaping the sea’s hold— a vision of a tundra reclaiming the desiccated grass, but they want to be villagers again. You build terraces for the ancient woods to breathe, but haunted by maggots eating their dead bullock—the speed of light is always late—they’ve become villagers again.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My mother forgets to feed her animals because it's only fair. She rushes to them when she hears hoarse roosters crowing and billy goats butting over a last straw. This month the moon becomes a princess. The stars fan her, Jupiter pours cups of wine, Mars sings melancholy mawals. Bearded men holding prayer beads and yellow booklets stare at her and point aching fingers at her waist. In our house we break a fast with dates from Huun and glasses of buttermilk. Then on to bowls of lamb soup flavored with mint, trays of stuffed grape leaves, spiced fava beans drenched in olive oil and lemon juice. And that is only the beginning. The spirits of Johnny Walker and gin hide in the trunks of white Peugeots. In the nightclubs of my city, waiters serve only non-alcoholic beer and belly dancers cover themselves.

Before dawn he runs to one of his two wives, both named Salma, and loves her hurriedly, his hands barely touching a breast.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
That silence again a wall of feathers, and near enough to block the circuit of our time— Adobe wall, roads of dust— thirty two years until the bones discoursed— That's how long I've dug into myself— And the baby? She is a promise— ungraspable, mist— Fuss or no fuss, yearn, yearn, yearn. Heart pounds, ears throb— Will it ask the question tattooed on our skin? Until dirt fills my grave, you say. Call it wait or rest—the stare, the lunge back into what we can’t swim— Another shore now— how our arms flail the joints’ acidic burn— A hunger unbeknownst to us, a flame cupped in skin—earth turning us toward a thin stream of self—Oh anticipant, Oh dear loving Lord—to hold a burden like a need and let a new life begin.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Even the wind wants to become a cart pulled by butterflies. I remember madness leaning for the first time on the mind’s pillow. I was talking to my body then and my body was an idea I wrote in red. Red is the sun’s most beautiful throne and all the other colors worship on red rugs. Night is another candle. In every branch, an arm, a message carried in space echoed by the body of the wind. The sun insists on dressing itself in fog when it meets me: Am I being scolded by the light? Oh, my past days— they used to walk in their sleep and I used to lean on them. Love and dreams are two parentheses. Between them I place my body and discover the world. Many times I saw the air fly with two grass feet and the road dance with feet made of air. My wishes are flowers staining my days. I was wounded early, and early I learned that wounds made me. I still follow the child who still walks inside me. Now he stands at a staircase made of light searching for a corner to rest in and to read the face of night again. If the moon were a house, my feet would refuse to touch its doorstep. They are taken by dust carrying me to the air of seasons. I walk, one hand in the air, the other caressing tresses that I imagine. A star is also a pebble in the field of space. He alone who is joined to the horizon can build new roads. A moon, an old man, his seat is night and light is his walking stick. What shall I say to the body I abandoned in the rubble of the house in which I was born? No one can narrate my childhood except those stars that flicker above it and that leave footprints on the evening’s path. My childhood is still being born in the palms of a light whose name I do not know and who names me. Out of that river he made a mirror and asked it about his sorrow. He made rain out of his grief and imitated the clouds. Your childhood is a village. You will never cross its boundaries no matter how far you go. His days are lakes, his memories floating bodies. You who are descending from the mountains of the past, how can you climb them again, and why? Time is a door I cannot open. My magic is worn, my chants asleep. I was born in a village, small and secretive like a womb. I never left it. I love the ocean not the shores.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The cities dissolve, and the earth is a cart loaded with dust Only poetry knows how to pair itself to this space. No road to this house, a siege, and his house is graveyard. From a distance, above his house a perplexed moon dangles from threads of dust. I said: this is the way home, he said: No you can’t pass, and aimed his bullet at me. Very well then, friends and their homes in all of Beirut’s are my companions. Road for blood now— Blood about which a boy talked whispered to his friends: nothing remains in the sky now except holes called “stars.” The city’s voice was too tender, even the winds would not tune its strings— The city’s face beamed like a child arranging his dreams for nightfall bidding the morning to sit beside him on his chair. They found people in bags: a person without a head a person without hands, or tongue a person choked to death and the rest had no shapes and no names. —Are you mad? Please don’t write about these things. A page in a book bombs mirror themselves inside of it prophecies and dust-proverbs mirror themselves inside of it cloisters mirror themselves inside of it, a carpet made of the alphabet disentangles thread by thread falls on the face of the city, slipping out of the needles of memory. A murderer in the city’s air, swimming through its wound— its wound is a fall that trembled to its name—to the hemorrhage of its name and all that surrounds us— houses left their walls behind and I am no longer I. Maybe there will come a time in which you’ll accept to live deaf and mute, maybe they’ll allow you to mumble: death and life resurrection and peace unto you. From the wine of the palms to the quiet of the desert . . . et cetera from a morning that smuggles its own intestines and sleeps on the corpses of the rebels . . . et cetera from streets, to trucks from soldiers, armies . . . et cetera from the shadows of men and women . . . et cetera from bombs hidden in the prayers of monotheists and infidels . . . et cetera from iron that oozes iron and bleeds flesh . . . et cetera from fields that long for wheat, and grass and working hands . . . et cetera from forts that wall our bodies and heap darkness upon us . . . et cetera from legends of the dead who pronounce life, who steer our life . . . et cetera from talk that is slaughter and slaughter and slitters of throats . . . et cetera from darkness to darkness to darkness I breathe, touch my body, search for myself and for you, and for him, and for the others and I hang my death between my face and this hemorrhage of talk . . . et cetera You will see— say his name say you drew his face reach out your hand toward him or smile or say I was happy once or say I was sad once you will see: there is no country there. Murder has changed the city’s shape—this stone is a child’s head— and this smoke is exhaled from human lungs. Each thing recites its exile . . . a sea of blood—and what do you expect on these mornings except their arteries set to sail into the darkness, into the tidal wave of slaughter? Stay up with her, don’t let up— she sits death in her embrace and turns over her days tattered sheets of paper. Guard the last pictures of her topography— she is tossing and turning in the sand in an ocean of sparks— on her bodies are the spots of human moans. Seed after seed are cast into our earth— fields feeding on our legends, guard the secret of these bloods. I am talking about a flavor to the seasons and a flash of lightning in the sky.

Bells on our eyelashes and the death throes of words, and I among fields of speech, a knight on a horse made of dirt. My lungs are my poetry, my eyes a book, and I, under the skin of words, on the beaming banks of foam, a poet who sang and died leaving this singed elegy before the faces of poets, for birds at the edge of sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. The leaves asleep under the wind are the wounds’ ship, and the ages collapsed on top of each other are the wound’s glory, and the trees rising out of our eyelashes are the wound’s lake. The wound is to be found on bridges where the grave lengthens and patience goes on to no end between the shores of our love and death. The wound is a sign, and the wound is a crossing too. 2. To the language choked by tolling bells I offer the voice of the wound. To the stone coming from afar to the dried-up world crumbling to dust to the time ferried on creaky sleighs I light up the fire of the wound. And when history burns inside my clothes and when blue nails grow inside my books, I cry out to the day, “Who are you, who tosses you into my virgin land?” And inside my book and on my virgin land I stare into a pair of eyes made of dust. I hear someone saying, “I am the wound that is born and grows as your history grows.” 3. I named you cloud, wound of the parting dove. I named you book and quill and here I begin the dialogue between me and the ancient tongue in the island of tomes in the archipelago of the ancient fall. And here I teach these words to the wind and the palms, O wound of the parting dove. 4. If I had a harbor in the land of dreams and mirrors, if I had a ship, if I had the remains of a city, if I had a city in the land of children and weeping, I would have written all this down for the wound’s sake, a song like a spear that penetrates trees, stone, and sky, soft like water unbridled, startling like conquest. 5. Rain down on our desert O world adorned with dream and longing. Pour down, and shake us, we, the palms of the wound, tear out branches from trees that love the silence of the wound, that lie awake staring at its pointed eyelashes and soft hands. World adorned with dream and longing world that falls on my brow like the lash of a wound, don’t come close—the wound is closer— don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful. That magic that your eyes had flung on the last kingdoms— the wound has passed over it, passed and did not leave a single sail to tempt toward salvation, did not leave a single island behind.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

One of those appointments you postpone until anxiety propels you to the phone, then have to wait too long for, to take an inconvenient time . . . Late in the day, an old man and I watch the minute hand on the waiting room wall. I’ve papers to grade, but he wants someone to talk to, and his attendant’s rude, so he turns his whiskery face to me: “Y’ know, I lived my whole life in Waltham, worked 40 years at the watch factory—oh, that city used to be so beautiful, now it’s a mess, those Cubans and Puerto Ricans, they ruined it.” Coiled in his wheelchair, he’s mad for company, probably scared he’s dying, * and so am I. I don’t remember Watch City as beautiful the year I was eleven, when Merle and I rode the Grove Street bus to Moody Street to shoplift haircurlers and Pond’s Vanishing Cream, nickel items at the Waltham Woolworth’s. It was an old factory town, wooden triple-deckers, water rats swimming in the oily river. Merle and I didn’t risk a furtive life of crime in our well-kempt Auburndale where we thought we were well-known, and canoers paddled the same Charles River past our homes. And I still wonder what could have vanished when we rubbed the mystery elixir on our silky cheeks? * His cheeks sucked in, this geezer could be my grandfather forty years ago, so I ignore his racist overture and agree Waltham was beautiful, as the attendant takes his Social Security card, and whistles: “Boy, are you old!” then mutters something else in Spanish. The number must be low. . . . “1936— that was the first year of Social Security!” the old guy brags. The kid forsakes our ancient history, flexes his muscles. He’s probably been listening to insults for an hour in the Elder Van, he’s bored and angry—why should he be nice? Yet hungry for a distracting fact or story, I encourage the grandfather, I want to be treated well myself some day, when I’ll need it even more than I do now. . . .My little bids for attention, my birds, fragilefluttering words, desire to be visible and seen. . . . “FDR was okay, wasn’t he?” I’m playing 90, it’s what I do to make us both less lonely, reminisce as if we’d shared the ’30s, as if I’d been there, come from Sicily or Limerick, a seamstress earning her hard living one town over. I always sat this way with Doc, years after he’d retired, his best treasure (besides my golden mother) a gold pocket watch, a Handsome Waltham watch— * a different time, when the things a person held or owned weren’t many but were permanent, a part of who you were. So his elegant watch confused me toward the idea my little dentist grandfather had some connection to the company, as if he’d labored there, a master craftsman, had been rewarded by a grateful boss. His bit of luxury, the swirling monogram on the back (which opened with a click), IR, for Isaac Rosenberg, timepiece connected by a chain to a safety pin at his frayed striped trouser pocket; another pin secured his Shawmut bankbook, deposits he’d made decades before * that I’d inherit, $214, Shawmut branch nearby the long-gone Waldorf Cafeteria where he idled weekday mornings with his cronies, also reminiscing, I suppose (although then I didn’t think of it), the Good Old Days before the motorcar, before their children moved away. Dexterity and skill gone, too, from his arthritic hands. He relished those mornings! The black-and-white tiled floor, the nearly empty tables, the Perfection Salad, Welsh rarebit, the “bloomberry pie.” The counterman.They serve an elegant porridge there, he told me, gourmet of the ordinary,State-of-Maine-ah grandfather, my Mainiac. The soon-to-be-widowed wives elsewhere, polishing mahogany veneer, or playing bridge, or shopping Coolidge Corner from butcher to baker in prescient black dresses. Old men and women so relieved to be rid of the burden of one another for a whole morning, of the tired bickering sentences of long American marriages, of pain and disappointment.

The game of baseball is not a metaphor and I know it’s not really life. The chalky green diamond, the lovely dusty brown lanes I see from airplanes multiplying around the cities are only neat playing fields. Their structure is not the frame of history carved out of forest, that is not what I see on my ascent. And down in the stadium, the veteran catcher guiding the young pitcher through the innings, the line of concentration between them, that delicate filament is not like the way you are helping me, only it reminds me when I strain for analogies, the way a rookie strains for perfection, and the veteran, in his wisdom, seems to promise it, it glows from his upheld glove, and the man in front of me in the grandstand, drinking banana daiquiris from a thermos, continuing through a whole dinner to the aromatic cigar even as our team is shut out, nearly hitless, he is not like the farmer that Auden speaks of in Breughel’s Icarus, or the four inevitable woman-hating drunkards, yelling, hugging each other and moving up and down continuously for more beer and the young wife trying to understand what a full count could be to please her husband happy in his old dreams, or the little boy in the Yankees cap already nodding off to sleep against his father, program and popcorn memories sliding into the future, and the old woman from Lincoln, Maine, screaming at the Yankee slugger with wounded knees to break his leg this is not a microcosm, not even a slice of life and the terrible slumps, when the greatest hitter mysteriously goes hitless for weeks, or the pitcher’s stuff is all junk who threw like a magician all last month, or the days when our guys look like Sennett cops, slipping, bumping each other, then suddenly, the play that wasn’t humanly possible, the Kid we know isn’t ready for the big leagues, leaps into the air to catch a ball that should have gone downtown, and coming off the field is hugged and bottom-slapped by the sudden sorcerers, the winning team the question of what makes a man slump when his form, his eye, his power aren’t to blame, this isn’t like the bad luck that hounds us, and his frustration in the games not like our deep rage for disappointing ourselves the ball park is an artifact, manicured, safe, “scene in an Easter egg”, and the order of the ball game, the firm structure with the mystery of accidents always contained, not the wild field we wander in, where I’m trying to recite the rules, to repeat the statistics of the game, and the wind keeps carrying my words away@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Sometimes she’s Confucian—resolute in privation. . . . Each day, more immobile, hip not mending, legs swollen; still she carries her grief with a hard steadiness. Twelve years uncompanioned, there’s no point longing for what can’t return. This morning, she tells me, she found a robin hunched in the damp dirt by the blossoming white azalea. Still there at noon— she went out in the yard with her 4-pronged metal cane— it appeared to be dying. Tonight, when she looked again, the bird had disappeared and in its place, under the bush, was a tiny egg— “Beautiful robin’s-egg blue”— she carried carefully indoors. “Are you keeping it warm?” I ask—what am I thinking?— And she: “Gail, I don’t want a bird, I want a blue egg.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Asleep until noon, I'm dreaming we've been granted another year. You're here with me, healthy. Then, half-awake, the half-truth— this is our last day. Life's leaking away again, and this time, we know it. Dear body, I told you, pleading,Don't Leave! but I understand you can't say anything. Who are we? Are we fictional? We don't look like our pictures, don't look like anyone I know. Daylight flickers through a bamboo grove, we approach the Forbidden City, Looking together for the Hall of Fulfilling Original Wishes.Time is the treasure, you tell me,and the past is its hiding place. I instruct our fictional children,The past is the treasure, time is its hiding place. If we told him how much we love him, how much we miss him, he could stay. But now you've taken me back to Luoyang, to the Garden of Solitary Joy, over a thousand years old— I wake, I hold your hand, you let me go.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I want to find my way back to her, to help her, to grab her hand, pull her up from the wooden floor of the stacks where she’s reading accounts of the hatchet murders of Lizzie Borden’s harsh parents as if she could learn something about life if she knew all the cuts and slashes; her essay on Wordsworth or Keats only a knot in her belly, a faint pressure at her temples. She’s pale, it’s five years before the first migraine, but the dreamy flush has already drained from her face. I want to lead her out of the library, to sit with her on a bench under a still living elm tree, be one who understands, but even today I don’t understand, I want to shake her and want to assure her, to hold her—but love’s not safe for her, although she craves what she knows of it, love’s a snare, a closed door, a dank cell. Maybe she should just leave the campus, take a train to Fall River, inspect Lizzie’s room, the rigid corsets and buttoned shoes, the horsehair sofas, the kitchen’s rank stew. Hell. Bleak loyal judgmental journals of a next-door neighbor—not a friend, Lizzie had no friend. If only she could follow one trajectory of thought, a plan, invent a journey out of this place, a vocation— but without me to guide her, where would she go? And what did I ever offer, what stiffening of spine? What goal? Rather, stiffening of soul, her soul cocooned in the library’s trivia. Soul circling its lessons. What can I say before she walks like a ghost in white lace carrying her bouquet of stephanotis, her father beaming innocently at her side, a boy waiting, trembling, to shape her? He’s innocent, too, we are all innocent, even Lizzie Borden who surely did take the axe. It was so hot that summer morning. The hard-hearted stepmother, heavy hand of the father. There was another daughter they favored, and Lizzie, stewing at home, heavy smell of mutton in the pores of history. But this girl, her story’s still a mystery—I tell myself she’s a quick study, a survivor. There’s still time. Soon she’ll close the bloody book, slink past the lit carrels, through the library’s heavy door to the world.Is it too late to try to touch her, kneel beside her on the dusty floor where we’re avoiding her assignment?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The black kitten cries at her bowlmeek meek and the gray one glowers from the windowsill. My hand on the can to serve them. First day of spring. Yesterday I drove my little mother for hours through wet snow. Her eightieth birthday. What she wanted was that ride with me— shopping, gossiping, mulling old grievances, 1930, 1958, 1970. How cruel the world has been to her, how uncanny she’s survived it. In her bag, a birthday card from “my Nemesis,” signed Sincerely with love—“Why is she doing this to me?” she demands, “She hates me.” “Maybe she loves you” is and isn’t what Mother wants to hear, maybe after sixty years the connection might as well be love.Might well be love, I don’t say— I won’t spoil her birthday, my implacable mother. In Byfield, in the snowstorm, we bought things at an antiques mall, she a miniature Sunbonnet Baby creamer and saucer— a bargain!—I, a chrome ice bucket stamped with penguins, with Bakelite handles. I wanted it, I had one just like it at home. Sometimes I think the only thing I’m sure I want is what I have. “What do you wish for?” I asked a friend, I was so curious to know how he’d formulate a wish, to know if there is a formula. His list was deliciously simple, my friend the hedonist: a penthouse with a concierge, “wonderful food,” months in Mexico, good movies . . . . Last night, you and I watched “The Way We Were” and I cried— I always do—for the wanting in it, and the losing. “It’s a great movie,” I said, to justify my tears. I wish you were more like me. Streisand and Redford, so opposite it’s emblematic, almost a cliché. Each wants or needs the other to change, so the pushy Jewish lefty, Barbara, should be quiet, accommodating, and the accommodating, handsome, laid-back “nice gentile boy” should agree with her that people are their principles. He thinks people can relax a little, be happy. If only they could both becomenothing, they can stay together. All her wishing and wanting and needing won’t make that happen. She marches against the Nazis, the Blacklist, the bomb, through the movie decades, and he doesn’t want to be a great unpopular novelist, so he writes badly for movies, and later, television. At the end (it’s the early ’60s), when they meet again in front of the Plaza, his look—the blank Redford quizzicality I’ve learned is his whole expressive repertoire— seems to ask, “Why? Why did I love you? Why do I still? Why aren’t you like me?” And because the director’s a liberal, Streisand’s the wiser one, more human than Redford—she’s leafletting, to ban the bomb, in the ’70s she’ll be Another Mother for Peace—the way she wriggles her sensual mouth (a mannerism that’s become familiar in the years since this movie was new) I know she loves him or at least yearns for him, still wants him, which is more piercing, more selfish. This morning, my throat is constricted, my head aches, I’m always like this, this movie reminds me you don’t get what you want, even if you’re not weak, or mean, or criminal. I wish I didn’t believe that message so utterly. Today I need to believe something more useful, more positive. Once, when I was a child, my mother lied to me. Maybe that day I was too demanding, more likely I needed consolation—my schoolmates so lucky, so confident, so gentile. Either she meant to reassure me, or—more likely— to instruct when she said (she couldn’t have believed it, the ’40s had happened) that the meek inherit the earth. That was lesson one of our course in resignation. My little mother, little kitten, be patient, I’m trying, it’s for you I’m opening this can of worms, for you I’m opening this can of food.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the warming house, children lace their skates, bending, choked, over their thick jackets. A Franklin stove keeps the place so cozy it’s hard to imagine why anyone would leave, clumping across the frozen beach to the river. December’s always the same at Ware’s Cove, the first sheer ice, black, then white and deep until the city sends trucks of men with wooden barriers to put up the boys’ hockey rink. An hour of skating after school, of trying wobbly figure-8’s, an hour of distances moved backwards without falling, then—twilight, the warming house steamy with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs aching. Outside, the hockey players keep playing, slamming the round black puck until it’s dark, until supper. At night, a shy girl comes to the cove with her father. Although there isn’t music, they glide arm in arm onto the blurred surface together, braced like dancers. She thinks she’ll never be so happy, for who else will find her graceful, find her perfect, skate with her in circles outside the emptied rink forever?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I’d dislocated my life, so I went to the zoo. It was December but it wasn’t December. Pansies just planted were blooming in well-groomed beds. Lovers embraced under the sky’s Sunday blue. Children rode around and around on pastel trains. I read the labels stuck on every cage the way people at museums do, art being less interesting than information. Each fenced-in plot had a map, laminated with a stain to tell where in the world the animals had been taken from. Rhinos waited for rain in the rhino-colored dirt, too grief-struck to move their wrinkles, their horns too weak to ever be hacked off by poachers for aphrodisiacs. Five white ducks agitated the chalky waters of a duck pond with invisible orange feet while a little girl in pink ruffles tossed pork rinds at their disconsolate backs. This wasn’t my life! I’d meant to look with the wise tough eye of exile, I wanted not to anthropomorphize, not to equate, for instance, the lemur’s displacement with my displacement. The arched aviary flashed with extravagance, plumage so exuberant, so implausible, it seemed cartoonish, and the birdsongs unintelligible, babble, all their various languages unravelling— no bird can get its song sung right, separated from models of its own species. For weeks I hadn’t written a sentence, for two days I hadn’t spoken to an animate thing. I couldn’t relate to a giraffe— I couldn’t look one in the face. I’d have said, if anyone had asked, I’d been mugged by the Gulf climate. In a great barren space, I watched a pair of elephants swaying together, a rhythm too familiar to be mistaken, too exclusive. My eyes sweated to see the bull, his masterful trunk swinging, enter their barn of concrete blocks, to watch his obedient wife follow. I missed the bitter tinny Boston smell of first snow, the huddling in a cold bus tunnel. At the House of Nocturnal Mammals, I stepped into a furtive world of bats, averted my eyes at the gloomy dioramas, passed glassed-in booths of lurking rodents— had I known I’d find what I came for at last?How did we get here, dear sloth, my soul, my sister? Clinging to a tree-limb with your three-toed feet, your eyes closed tight, you calm my idleness, my immigrant isolation. But a tiny tamarin monkey who shares your ersatz rainforest runs at you, teasing, until you move one slow, dripping, hairy arm, then the other, the other, the other, pulling your tear-soaked body, its too-few vertebrae, its inferior allotment of muscles along the dead branch, going almost nowhere slowly as is humanly possible, nudged by the bright orange primate taunting, nipping, itching at you all the time, like ambition.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Brave Mayakovsky, doomed Mayakovsky, He could sass you, and later O'Hara (Before they turned forty, both gone) Sassed you and sassed Mayakovsky, too— But when I try I know it's just another Instance of me whistling in the dark, Me not blazing, me not burning out.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Clarice, the Swiss Appraiser, paces our rooms, listing furnishings on her yellow legal pad with a Waterman pen, a microcamera. Although I've asked why we have to do this, I forgot the answer. The answer to why is because, inscrutable, outside of logic, helpless, useless because. Wing chairs, a deco lamp, my mother's cherry dining table—nothing we both loved using looks tragic. Most nights now I sit in the den reading the colorful spines of your art books, Fra Angelico to Zurburan, volume after volume of Balthus, Botticelli, Cezanne, Degas, Michelangelo, Monet, Titian, Velasquez. Friends. An art school's asked for them— after all, they have no \"real\" value now, except to me.... Upstairs, Cerise—is that her name?—gasps at the bentwood chaise, the blonde moderne bedroom \"set\" my parents bought on their two-day Depression honeymoon in Manhattan. I know this has something to do with paying taxes. Last night, a real icy February zero, I went out to start the engine of the car you gave me on my birthday, to keep it going, then came in and forgot it till this morning. I woke to the city's recycling truck grinding my papers and plastic bottles and my motor running. And still, I wasn't out of gas, Our neighbor, his head in a red bandana, yelled, \"We didn't want to bother you at one in the morning!\" and I thought, How did you know I wasn't in there, suiciding? Cerise means \"cherry,\" Clarice means \"light\" or \"famous\"— is her name Clarissa? What is she saying? She's blurring, she looks like a Candice, she looks nice enough, but I'll defer judgement until she's finished this business. If I let on I felt sad, remember my mother's advice? \"Everyone should collect something!\" That was her path to the purpose-driven life, along rows of a flea market, then alone in her house jammed with the nicked, the chipped, ceramics with dings, the inscribed wedding bands of strangers— damaged things that always needed gluing or polishing. I tried not to teach our children the world's a dangerous place, but there we were, four of us, plunked into history, listening to Dylan. Then, two of us. Our son and daughter out in it, unafraid, purposeful.... Somehow, life veered from the script. I should get a new cell phone, but eighteen of your messages are in/on my old one and can't be transferred. How can Verizon say your voice isn't really in there at all, calling home to me?—Then where is it? Why should it disappear from somewhere is unapparently isn't? Why should my living here be so metaphysical? Callista enters our bedroom, the room sacrosanct to me, off-limits, but no matter. She scans our night tables, our TV, our pills and lotions and clippers. Oh, morning here you'd perform what you'd call your \"ablutions\" while I read the paper in bed. Pearl slinks from her place on my pillow, Bogey's hunched in the clothes closer on your shearling slippers, Hosni Mubarak's been deposed, Benghazi's a riot of freedom until the Khadaffis say it isn't. The day you died, I knew what people meant by saying the earth stopped spinning on its axis. No choice but to write myself, to keep going. Today's Science Times says we're not in the Garden of Eden anymore— well, that shouldn't give evolutionary biologists pause. Life, says the geologists, is a natural consequence of geology. Geology? I know there's got to be more to be written. Clarissa, Clarinda, Career, whatever your name is, pack up your digital camera, your officious watery pen, your scrutineer's notepad, you're in the wrong biosphere, your data will never add up—Clarity, I think we're done here.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
On the telephone, friends mistake us now when we first say hello—not after. And that oddly optimistic lilt we share nourishes my hopes: we do sound happy. . . . Last night, in my dream’s crib, a one-day infant girl. I wasn’t totally unprepared— there was the crib, and cotton kimonos, not just a padded dresser drawer. And then, I knew I could drive to the store for the tiny, funny clothes my daughter wears. I was in a familiar room and leaned over the rail, crooningHello, and the smiling baby— she’d be too young for speech, I know, or smiles— gurgled back at me, Hullo. —If I could begin again, I’d hold her longer, closer! Maybe that way, when night opens into morning, and all my windows gape at the heartbreaking street, my dreams wouldn’t pierce so, I wouldn’t hold my breath at the parts of my life still in hiding, my childhood’s white house where I lunged toward the flowers of love as if I were courting death. . . . Over the crib, a mobile was spinning, bright birds going nowhere, primary colors, primary as mothering once seemed. . . . Later, I wonder why I dreamt that dream, yearning for what I’ve had, and have why it was my mother’s room, the blonde moderne bedroom set hidden under years of junk—a spare room’s the nicest way to put it, though now all her crowded rooms are spare—@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
of these long scorching days but today my daughter is truly exasperating—Stop it! I shout—or I’ll— and I twist her little pinked arm slowly, calibrating my ferocity—You can’t hurt me you can’t hurt me! She’s so defiant, glowering, glaring at me— but frightened, her eyes bright with tears—See, I’m not even crying! I see. But it’s the angel of extermination I see, shining in his black trappings, and turning ecstatically toward him, a little Jewish girl tempts him to play his game of massacre. —after Vittorio Sereni@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I've already grown a goiter from this torture, hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy (or anywhere else where the stagnant water's poison). My stomach's squashed under my chin, my beard's pointing at heaven, my brain's crushed in a casket, my breast twists like a harpy's. My brush, above me all the time, dribbles paint so my face makes a fine floor for droppings! My haunches are grinding into my guts, my poor ass strains to work as a counterweight, every gesture I make is blind and aimless. My skin hangs loose below me, my spine's all knotted from folding over itself. I'm bent taut as a Syrian bow. Because I'm stuck like this, my thoughts are crazy, perfidious tripe: anyone shoots badly through a crooked blowpipe. My painting is dead. Defend it for me, Giovanni, protect my honor. I am not in the right place—I am not a painter.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
He reminds me of someone I used to know, but who? Before class, he comes to my office to shmooze, a thousand thousand pointless interesting speculations. Irrepressible boy, his assignments are rarely completed, or actually started. This week, instead of research in the stacks, he’s performing with a reggae band that didn’t exist last week. Kids danced to his music and stripped, he tells me gleefully, high spirit of the street festival. He’s the singer, of course— why ask if he studied an instrument? On the brink of graduating with an engineering degree (not, it turned out, his forte), he switched to English, his second language. It’s hard to swallow the bravura of his academic escapes or tell if the dark eyes laugh with his face. Once, he brought me a tiny persimmon he’d picked on campus; once, a poem about an elderly friend in New Delhi who left him volumes of Tagore and memories of avuncular conversation. My encouragement makes him skittish— it doesn’t suit his jubilant histrionics of despair. And I remember myself shrinking from enthusiasm or praise, the prospect of effort-drudgery. Success—a threat. A future, we figure, of revision—yet what can the future be but revision and repair? Now, on the brink again, graduation’s postponed, the brilliant thesis on Walker Percy unwritten. “I’ll drive to New Orleans and soak it up and write my paper in a weekend,” he announces in the Honors office. And, “I want to be a bum in daytime and a reggae star at night!” What could I give him from my life or art that matters, how share the desperate slumber of my early years, the flashes of inspiration and passion in a life on hold? If I didn’t fool myself or anyone, no one could touch me, or tell me much . . . This gloomy Houston Monday, he appears at my door, so sunny I wouldn’t dare to wake him now, or say it matters if he wakes at all. “Write a poem about me!” he commands, and so I do.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I say to the named granite stone, to the brown grass, to the dead chrysanthemums, Mother, I still have a body, what else could receive my mind's transmissions, its dots and dashes of pain? I expect and get no answer, no loamy scent of her coral geraniums. She who is now immaterial, for better or worse, no longer needs to speak for me to hear, as in a continuous loop, classic messages of wisdom, love and fury. MAKE! DO! a note on our fridge commanded. Here I am making, unmaking, doing, undoing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Crouched before dismantled guns, we found war souvenirs our uncle padlocked in the attic, a brittle latch easily pried off. Stiff uniforms on top, snapshots of soldiers young as our cousins, a velvet box of medals as if he fought all battles in World War II. Bayonets, machetes, a folded flag, two hand grenades with missing pins. We picked up teeth like pennies, loose, as if tossed in, a piece of something dark and waxy like a fig, curved like a question mark, a human ear. We touched dried pieces of cloth stuck to curved bones and held them to the light, turning them over and over, wondering how did uncles learn to kill, what would happen when we grew up.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Barbed wires on rusted nails can’t hold lone bulls at home when they smell pasture. They thrust their bone skulls under barbs, tongues quivering for a taste of strange and shove until the post gives way. Days later, we find wires sagging, reset the post, and tighten bent wires like a fiddle and rope the worn-out bull, wishing there was only a fence between us and our heart’s desire. But something with spurs and a rope would find us, cursing and yelling on horseback, cutting us from escape down arroyos, dragging us frothing and wild-eyed back to the sun-bleached yellow range, the same whirlpool of buzzards.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
From Michigan our son writes, How many elk? How many big horn sheep? It's spring, and soon they'll be gone above timberline, climbing to tundra by summer. Some boys are born to wander, my wife says, but rocky slopes with spruce and Douglas fir are home. He tried the navy, the marines, but even the army wouldn't take him, not with a foot like that. Maybe it's in the genes. I think of wild-eyed years till I was twenty, and cringe. I loved motorcycles, too dumb to say no to our son—too many switchbacks in mountains, too many icy spots in spring. Doctors stitched back his scalp, hoisted him in traction like a twisted frame. I sold the motorbike to a junkyard, but half his foot was gone. Last month, he cashed his paycheck at the Harley house, roared off with nothing but a backpack, waving his headband, leaning into a downhill curve and gone.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1 Gravel paths on hillsides amid moon-drawn vineyards, click of pearls upon a polished nightstand soft as rainwater, self-minded stars, oboe music distant as the grinding of icebergs against the hull of the self and the soul in the darkness chanting to the ecstatic chance of existence. Deep is the water and long is the moonlight inscribing addresses in quicksilver ink, building the staircase a lover forever pauses upon. Deep is the darkness and long is the night, solid the water and liquid the light. How strange that they arrive at all, nights on planet earth. 2 Sometimes, not often but repeatedly, the past invades my dreams in the form of a familiar neighborhood I can no longer locate, a warren of streets lined with dark cafés and unforgettable bars, a place where I can sing by heart every song on every jukebox, a city that feels the way the skin of an octopus looks pulse-changing from color to color, laminar and fluid and electric, a city of shadow-draped churches, of busses on dim avenues, or riverlights, or canyonlands, but always a city, and wonderful, and lost. Sometimes it resembles Amsterdam, students from the ballet school like fanciful gazelles shooting pool in pink tights and soft, shapeless sweaters, or Madrid at 4AM, arguing the 18th Brumaire with angry Marxists, or Manhattan when the snowfall crowns every trash-can king of its Bowery stoop, or Chicago, or Dublin, or some ideal city of the imagination, as in a movie you can neither remember entirely nor completely forget, barracuda-faced men drinking sake like yakuza in a Harukami novel, women sipping champagne or arrack, the rattle of beaded curtains in the back, the necklaces of Christmas lights reflected in raindrops on windows, the taste of peanuts and their shells crushed to powder underfoot, always real, always elusive, always a city, and wonderful, and lost. All night I wander alone, searching in vain for the irretrievable. 3 In the night I will drink from a cup of ashes and yellow paint. In the night I will gossip with the clouds and grow strong. In the night I will cross rooftops to watch the sea tremble in a dream. In the night I will assemble my army of golden carpenter ants. In the night I will walk the towpath among satellites and cosmic dust. In the night I will cry to the roots of potted plants in empty offices. In the night I will gather the feathers of pigeons in a honey jar. In the night I will become an infant before your flag.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
If Socrates drank his portion of hemlock willingly,if the Appalachians have endured unending ages of erosion,if the wind can learn to read our minds and moonlight moonlight as a master pickpocket,surely we can contend with contentment as our commission.Deer in a stubble field, small birds dreamingunimaginable dreams in hollow trees,even the icicles, darling, even the icicles shame uswith their stoicism, their radiant resolve. Listen to me now: think of something you love but not too dearly, so the night will steal from usonly what we can afford to lose.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Today is a trumpet to set the hounds baying.The past is a fox the hunters are flaying.Nothing unspoken goes without saying.Love’s a casino where lovers risk playing.The future’s a marker our hearts are prepaying.The future’s a promise there’s no guaranteeing.Today is a fire the field mice are fleeing.Love is a marriage of feeling and being.The past is a mirror for wishful sightseeing.Nothing goes missing without absenteeing.Nothing gets cloven except by dividing.The future is chosen by atoms colliding.The past’s an elision forever eliding.Today is a fog bank in which I am hiding.Love is a burn forever debriding.Love’s an ascent forever plateauing.Nothing is granted except by bestowing.Today is an anthem the cuckoos are crowing.The future’s a convolute river onflowing.The past is a lawn the neighbor is mowing.The past is an answer not worth pursuing,Nothing gets done except by the doing.The future’s a climax forever ensuing.Love is only won by wooing.Today is a truce between reaping and rueing.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The last two sherpas were the strongest,faithful companions, their faces wind-peeled,streaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfieldbelow the summit where we stopped to rest.The first was my body, snug in its cap of lynx-fur, smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirt,agile, impetuous, broad-shouldered,alive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx.The second was my intellect, dour and thirsty, furrowing its fox-like brow, my calculating brainsearching for some cairn or chasm to explainmy decision to send them back without me.Looking down from the next, ax-cleft serac I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid. Blind as a diamond, sun-pure and rarefied,whatever I was then, there was no turning back.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The news of your drowning burst a pipe in our kitchen, my lover's face scalloped with panic. Because I do not believe in coincidence, because I know that everything happens because someone has made it happen, we packed up our children and stayed in a hotel. When we returned the next morning, the children squealed at the minnows shimmering against the linoleum. The super, hunched over a bucket of seaweed, looked up and my infant daughter resting on my hip. She did this, he said, then he pointed at the birthmark, shaped like a squid, etched along her chin, That mark, it means she has a special power. I tucked my lover into our waterlogged bed. The dog didn't make it, he said. I'll bury her in the morning. That night, the moon was whiter than a whale and the neighbors across the courtyard made love wildly. I stood at my bedroom window and listened as my boys busied themselves, scooping out lobsters from behind the radiator and my baby girl, playing telephone with a conch shell, warned you never to set foot in this house again.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The newspapers said he targeted yellow houses so I hated our apartment building— its peach stucco exterior, shunned. Then it was written he preyed upon the elderly, deeming my nine-year old body useless. Too many of his victims were Asian so I cursed my Mexican grandfather. That summer, I learned, finally, what a pentagram looked like, and what it meant— an emblem of fear stitched upon the hearts of a god-fearing America who could not comprehend how a soulless man could climb into our homes to rape our wives and slit our throats. And I, defiant as a swatted bee, propped my bedroom window open with a book and said his name in the dark, the way a lonesome pig might summon the butcher:Richard. Richard. Each morning, I awoke, soaked in the piss of envy as a new victim's name staggered through our city like a bloodied lamb. Then the photograph: his face on the television screen, so sharp and empty it seemed drawn on. When he was captured, he smiled for the cameras and stuck out his tongue. All the women in the neighborhood became less important, all the guns were emptied, then put away; and the stranger's hands that finally found my body that year were softer than I had hoped, as if he were doing it more out of pity than of want, a monster suddenly aware of the harmless child standing before him, a child who had discovered every way to say Please without saying it@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I love my brother. He had the exact same childhood as I did. But he doesn't get credit for it. He isn't the writer. I am the star of the violence. I expose. My Peter, when he marries, I will be so sad. No girl in the world deserves him but me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I did it alone, without leaving. The welt on my face still hot, I crept downstairs, pried open the toolbox and grabbed the hammer with his initials burned deep into the handle. Upstairs, my brother slept in his room, a glass box of reptiles watching over him. I turned the knob slowly, and stood over my father's body, his chest heaving, then sinking, when his tongue rattled, then stopped, and the whites of his eyes rolled over, and he stared only at the weapon in my hand and I looked at him and said, If you ever touch us again, I will kill you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Before the burglar raped my grandmother he pushed her down a flight of stairs. Ankle turned, hip unhitched. There was no getting up, no hope for flight. She told me that while he was on top of her, she stared up at the clock from the kitchen floor. Watched each minute crawl by like a half-smashed bug, imagining the school bus emptying her sons into the yard. Thought of the sandwiches she had no time to make. As the man pulled his pants up, she noticed the tattoo on his forearm. MOTHER framed by a heart. My sons will be home soon, she explained. How many? Five. What she told me next I could never understand, not until I'd lived long enough in this temporary body, not until I'd lived long enough in this temporary body, not until I had five children of my own, how, when the man held out his hand, she took it. Neither of them speaking as she leaned all her weight onto her one good foot, the two of them standing in the kitchen, spreading butter onto bread.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When I was nineteen I stole a gun. The drug dealer next door, blitzed out of her skull, didn't see me pull it from her kitchen cupboard. As the California sun sank below the foothills, I haunted the neighborhood, screaming your doomed name. I was ready. A death-wish Romeo beneath your bedroom window. Split once a neighbor threatened to call the cops. I never told you this story. Not because I regret what I did, was prepared to do—those forty-five minutes of havoc, hunting down your head. Back then, I wasn't shit. Just electrified violence. All fists, piss & safety pins, an unwed teenage mother with no address. You had parents. Freckles. A three-story house. I'd listen to you spit your angsty fiction while I slept in parks & ate from garbage cans. When I learned you were coveting the man I loved, I felt my insides darken, cursed your well-fed royalty disguised as grit. Got tired of the forgery, wanted all the black-eyed wealth to myself: BANG, you're dead. Wish I could say I've put those days behind me, that I never fall into the steel-weight daydream of a gun's hard lesson. 1995—half my life ago—still, every time you call to bitch about your latest ex-soulmate or DUI, one more kid taken from you by the state I want to tell you about the only night you survived. When something said fall asleep & you did. Crashed hard with a starving bitch & pistol at the ready, birds still singing in the half daylight. I'll say it here, right now, one more time, with feeling: it was the only moment in this wretched life a god was on my side.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
My sweetheart says I can no longer watch the news. You worry too much. And he is right. My fear is a drilling. Constant. Bloodthick. That girl in the suitcase, that wife in the river, that woman in the elevator needed me. I worry to much, it is my right. My fear is a drilling, songless bird perched upon my shoulder. That wife in the river, that woman in the elevator needed me. But I have three girls of my own, they are mine mine mine and the songless bird perched upon my shoulder watches over them, my sweet little Gretels who follow me home, these three girls who are mine mine mine gobble up my heart like a hunk of bread. When men see them, my dear little Gretels, they follow me home. When there is a knock on the door, I stash my darlings in a cupboard. They come to gobble up my girls like hunks of bread. Men line up like ants to take them away, to carry them home. When there is a knock at my door, I hide my darlings inside a cupboard like bowls of sugar. When they sleep, I wrap them in kites strings, line them up like ants so no one can take them and carry them home. They clutch their dolls and all night long they wish for boys like bowls of sugar. As they sleep, I hold them like kite strings. Constant. Bloodthick. That girl in the suitcase, clutched her doll and all night long wished she'd been a boy. My sweetheart says I can no longer watch the news.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I have learned to need the body I spent years trying to rid the world of have learned to cherish its pale rebel hymn warped by ghost heat, carried, carried by all my loyal dead. I have learned to crawl backward into the wilderness to ask, to eat, to steep in your gentleness. Let this be where I permit forgiveness to know your name, to leave our cruelest years where & how we need them most— behind & unlit.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
was how you begged me to keep it. But you were never home, and I was but did not want to be. And by then you had become a man smaller than a man. So I thought it away. Closed my eyes one night and dreamt it out of me. And the next day, you knocked on the bathroom door. And you charged in and I stood and pointed. I said, Look at that. And you asked, Is that And I said, Yes. And you said, Oh, and then you shaved off your beard.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When my daughter rushes into the living room, cheeks flushed from her wicked siblings who spring from closets and unlit hallways, all the fear in the world blotched upon her small round face, I pretend sometimes that her body is being driven by you, that you have discovered a temporary passage between heaven and bone, and when I speak to her, I am really speaking to you, and I know we haven't much time— my daughter is young and must return to herself. So I speak urgently, each word a tiny grain of sand, spilling. It won't be long before she learns to repeat our conversations, breaking the privacy, the awkward third lover. Already she practices whispering into her hands, stands too long in an empty room, stares through her father at the dinner table. Each new year I feel the mud thickening beneath my feet. One morning she will wake up too old to remember any of this, delivering us to your second death. I am sure I will know it the moment it happens. The first time she comes home a few hours late, enters the house a woman I do not recognize.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How were we to know, leaving your two kids behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap hotels in New York City to draw customers like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby? Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door with a cut on one side the exact shape of the toilet bowl that was in its way when I closed it. I opened and shut the door, admiring the fit and despairing of it. You discovered the initials of lovers carved on the bureau’s top in a zigzag, breaking heart. How wrong the place was to us then, unable to see the portents of our future that seem so clear now in the naiveté of the arrangements we made, the hotel’s disdain for those with little money, the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay our love down, and in this way began our unwise and persistent and lucky life together.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
How the thickest of them erupt just above the ear, cresting in waves so stiff no wind can move them. Let us praise them in all of their varieties, some skinny as the bands of headphones, some rising from a part that extends halfway around the head, others four or five strings stretched so taut the scalp resembles a musical instrument. Let us praise the sprays that hold them, and the combs that coax such abundance to the front of the head in the mirror, the combers entirely forget the back. And let us celebrate the combers, who address the old sorrow of time’s passing day after day, bringing out of the barrenness of mid-life this ridiculous and wonderful harvest, no wishful flag of hope, but, thick, or thin, the flag itself, unfurled for us all in subways, offices, and malls across America.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It must be difficult for God, listening to our voices come up through his floor of cloud to tell Him what’s been taken away: Lord, I’ve lost my dog, my period, my hair, all my money. What can He say, given we’re so incomplete we can’t stop being surprised by our condition, while He is completeness itself? Or is God more like us, made in His image—shaking His head because He can’t be expected to keep track of which voice goes with what name and address, He being just one God. Either way, we seem to be left here to discover our losses, everything from car keys to larger items we can’t search our pockets for, destined to face them on our own. Even though the dentist gives us music to listen to and the assistant looks down with her lovely smile, it’s still our tooth he yanks out, leaving a soft spot we ponder with our tongue for days. Left to ourselves, we always go over and over what’s missing— tooth, dog, money, self-control, and even losses as troubling as the absence the widower can’t stop reaching for on the other side of his bed a year later. Then one odd afternoon, watching something as common as the way light from the window lingers over a vase on the table, or how the leaves on his backyard tree change colors all at once in a quick wind, he begins to feel a lightness, as if all his loss has led to finding just this. Only God knows where the feeling came from, or maybe God’s not some knower off on a cloud, but there in the eye, which tears up now at the strangest moments, over the smallest things.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In her last notes, when her hand began to tremble, my mother tried to teach it the penmanship she was known for, how to make the slanted stems of the p's and d's, the descending roundness of the capital m's, the long loops of the f's crossed at the center, sending it back again and again until each message was the same: a record of her insistence that the hand return her to the way she was before, and of all the ways the hand had disobeyed.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
At the end of my stepfather’s life when his anger was gone, and the saplings of his failed nursery had grown into trees, my newly feminist mother had him in the kitchen to pay for all those years he only did the carving. “You know where that is,” she would say as he looked for a knife to cut the cheese and a tray to serve it with, his apron wide as a dress above his workboots, confused as a girl. He is the one I think of now, lifting the tray for my family, the guests, until at last he comes to me. And I, no less confused, look down from his hurt eyes as if there were nothing between us except an arrangement of cheese, and not this bafflement, these almost tender hands that once swung hammers and drove machines and insisted that I learn to be a man.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In the apparent vacancy beyond each line, you might sense the poem waiting to think itself. Imagine the surface of a twilight pond in wind, shifting and changing the sky, then going still as a concentrating mind, the far trees deepening in its reflection. Like the poem the pond’s alive— its beauty (the sudden scintillation of a hundred thousand wavelets) and music (the percussion of a beaver’s tail) arising from what is. And when the pond accumulates the darkness, which it loves, it challenges your eyes to find the light that without darkness you could not see. Wild campsites you never noticed now appear along the far shore. It’s not only itself the poem waits for moving line by line into its own dark. It waits for you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
From down the road, starting up and stopping once more, the sound of a puppy on a chain who has not yet discovered he will spend his life there. Foolish dog, to forget where he is and wander until he feels the collar close fast around his throat, then cry all over again about the little space in which he finds himself. Soon, when there is no grass left in it and he understands it is all he has, he will snarl and bark whenever he senses a threat to it. Who would believe this small sorrow could lead to such fury no one would ever come near him?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
As the father turns away from the thought of his failure, the hands remove his glasses and rub his eyes over and over, drying the nonexistent tears. Unknown to the one who is troubled about losing his hair, his fingers stroke his baldness as he speaks. The body, our constant companion, understands the loneliness of the hostess in her dark driveway, embracing herself after the guests who promised more and soon have gone, and even visits the old schoolteacher who reads the same happy ending to each new class, working her toes in her shoes. How could the people of the kingdom not have known the curse of sorrow was nothing more than a long sleep they had only to wake from? In dreams the body, which longs for transformation too, suddenly lifts us above the dark roofs of our houses, and far above the streets of the town, until they seem like any other small things fastened to earth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
What became of the dear strands of hair pressed against the perspiration of your lover's brow after lovemaking as you gazed into the world of those eyes, now only yours?

What became of the one who believed so deeply in this moment he memorized everything in it and left it for you?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
When her recorded voice on the phone said who she was again and again to the piles of newspapers and magazines and the clothes in the chairs and the bags of unopened mail and garbage and piles of unwashed dishes.When she could no longer walk through the stench of it, in her don’t-need-nobody-to-help-me way of walking, with her head bent down to her knees as if she were searching for a dime that had rolled into a crack on the floor, though it was impossible to see the floor. When the pain in her foot she disclosedto no one was so bad she could not stand at her refrigerator packed with food and sniff to find what was edible. When she could hardly even sit as she loved to sit, all night on the toilet, with the old rinsed diapers hanging nearby on the curtainless bar of the shower stall, and the shoes lined upin the tub, falling asleep and waking up while she cut out newspaper clippings and listened to the late-night talk on her crackling radio about alien landings and why the government had denied them. When she drew the soapy rag across the agonizing ache of her foot trying over and over to washthe black from her big toe and could notbecause it was gangrene. When at last they came to carry my mother out of the wilderness of that houseand she lay thin and frail and disorientedbetween bouts of tests and X-rays, and I came to find her in the white bed of her white room among nurses who brushed her hair while she looked up at them and smiledwith her yellow upper plate that seemed to holdher face together, dazed and disbelieving, as if she were in heaven, then turned, still smiling, to the door where her stout, bestroked younger brother teetered into the room on his cane, all the way from Missouri with her elderly sister and her bald-headed baby brother, whom she despised. When he smiled backand dipped his bald head down to kiss her, and her sister and her other brother hugged herwith serious expressions, and her childish astonishment slowly changed to suspicion and the old wildness returnedto her eye because she began to see this was not what she wanted at all, I sitting down by her good ear holding her hand to talk to her about going into the homethat was not her home, her baby brother winking,the others nodding and saying, Listen to Wesley. When it became clear to her that we were not her people, the ones she had left behind in her house, on the radio, in the newspaper clippings, in the bags of unopened mail, in her mind, and she turned her face away so I could see the print of red on her cheek as if she had been slapped hard. When the three of them began to implore their older sister saying, Ruth, Ruth, and We come out here for your own good, and That time rolls around for all of us, getting frustrated and mad because they meant, but did not know they meant, themselves too.When the gray sister, the angriest of them, finally said through her pleated lips and lower plate, You was always the stubborn one, we ain’t here to poison you, turn around and say something.

Spared by a car or airplane crash or cured of malignancy, people look around with new eyes at a newly praiseworthy world, blinking eyes like these. For I’ve been brought back again from the fine silt, the mud where our atoms lie down for long naps. And I’ve also been pardoned miraculously for years by the lava of chance which runs down the world’s gullies, silting us back. Here I am, brought back, set up, not yet happened away. But it’s not this random life only, throwing its sensual astonishments upside down on the bloody membranes behind my eyeballs, not just me being here again, old needer, looking for someone to need, but you, up from the clay yourself, as luck would have it, and inching over the same little segment of earth- ball, in the same little eon, to meet in a room, alive in our skins, and the whole galaxy gaping there and the centuries whining like gnats— you, to teach me to see it, to see it with you, and to offer somebody uncomprehending, impudent thanks.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. Of Choice Despair is big with friends I love, Hydrogen and burning jews. I give them all the grief I have But I tell them, friends, I choose, I choose, Don’t make me say against my glands Or how the world has treated me. Though gay and modest give offense And people grieve pretentiously, More than I hoped to do, I do And more than I deserve I get; What little I attend, I know And it argues order more than not. My desperate friends, I want to tell Them, you take too delicate offense At the stench of time and man’s own smell, It is only the smell of consequence. II. Of Love People love each other and the light Of love gilds but doesn’t alter, People don’t change one another, can scarcely By taking will and thought add a little Now and then to their own statures Which, praise them, they do, So that here we are in all our sizes Flooded in the impartial daylight sometimes, Spotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves, Human, the beams of attention Of social animals at their work Which is loving; and sometimes all dark. The only correction is By you of you, by me of me. People are worth looking at in this light And if you listen what they are saying is, Love me sun out there whoever you are, Chasing me from bed in the morning, Spooking me all day with shadow, Surprising me whenever you fall; Make me conspicuous as I go here, Spotted by however many beams, Now light, finally dark. I fear There is meant to be a lot of darkness, You hear them say, but every last creature Is the one it meant to be. III. My Acts The acts of my life swarm down the street like Puerto Rican kids, Foreign but small and, except for one, unknived. They do no harm though their voices slash like reeds; All except one they have evidently been loved. And down the hill where I’ve planted spruce and red pine In a gang of spiked shadows they slouch at night. I am reasonably brave. I have been, except on one occasion, Myself: it is no good trying to be what you are not. We live among gangs who seem to have no stake In what we’re trying to do, no sense of property or race, Yet if you speak with authority they will halt and break And sullenly, one by one, show you a local face. I dreamt once that they caught me and, holding me down, Burned my genitals with gasoline; In my stupid terror I was telling them names So my manhood kept and the rest went up in flames. ‘Now, say the world is a fair place,’ the biggest one said, And because there was no face worse than my own there I said it and got up. Quite a lot of me is charred. By our code it is fair. We play fair. The world is fair.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Do not embrace your mind’s new negro friend Or embarrass the blackballed jew with memberships: There must be years of atonement first, and even then You may still be the blundering raconteur With the wrong story, and they may still be free. If you are with them, if even mind is friend, There will be plenty to do: give the liars lessons Who have heard no rumors of truth for a long time But have whatever they hear on good authority, Whether it concerns Chinese women or the arts. Expose the patrons, some of whose best friends Are brothers, and who are never now anonymous: What kind of credit do they expect for that, Ask them, or better, ask their protested brothers, The grateful tenants who can’t get their curtsies right. Finally the injured, who think they have no friend, Who have been convinced by the repeated names That they are jews or negroes or some dark thing: They must be courted with the lover’s touch And as guiltily as if yourself had turned them inward. If you complete this program, you will have friends From all the rich races of your human blood: Meantime, engage in the often friendless struggle. A long war, a pygmy war in ways, But island by island we must go across.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I. He Thinks of the Chinese Snake Who Is the Beginning and the End If you or I should die That day desire would not renew Itself in any bed. The old snake of the world, eternity That holds his tail in his mouth, Would spit it out And ease off through the grass Like a piece of music To we don’t know where. Then it would be for the living To beat the grass and bring him back. But would he be set tamely To sucking his tail again In that absence? II. He Marvels at the Persistence of Passion Like black duennas the hours sit And read our lips and watch our thighs. The years are pederasts: they wait For boys and will not meet my eyes. And children are cool astronomers Who scan us like old galaxies And calculate how many years Before we’ll turn to gas or freeze. And yet sometimes I have to shave And brush my teeth at dawn to keep My healthy middle-aged alive Hands off you where you lie asleep. III. Sometimes He Contemplates Adultery I had no insanity to excuse this, But for a week my heart ran with another love, Imagined another house, down to its books and bed. My miserable fluttered heart, you understand, chose this. Now I am led home—cold, grave, Contractual as a dog—by my scurrilous head. IV. His Hands, On a Trip to Wisconsin It is night. I am a thousand miles from home. My hands lie awake and are aware of themselves, One on my noisy chest, the other, the right one, A matter of several pounds, oppressing my forehead. It is a week since it fluted the air goodbye. I think of the path in space the thing has made since then, Veering and halting; of the shapes hands make Washing a car, or in the uses of music. Two shapes it has traced honor this right hand: The curve that a plane rides out As it leaves or takes a deck on the scalloped sea; Handily, handily then this two-pound creature Felt the wired air, let the two monsters kiss, The shapes that it graphed then fairer Than the hair of the clouds that watched Or the sea’s own scalloped hair. And he and his gauche fellow, moving symmetrically, Have described one body so well They could dress that shape in air As they long to do now though they lie Laced hunks of flesh on my belly— Ahead of them some years of roving Before the white landscape of age checks them, Your body’s disaster, sure to be traced there, Even so slight a change in a dear shape Halting them, baffled, lascivious suddenly, Or folded cold, or feeling your hands folded cold. V. Lines from His Guest-book Shelley’s houses and walks were always a clutter of women, and god knows what further arrangements he kept in his mind.Drôle de menage, Rimbaud said of himself and Verlaine, As if there were any other kind. In Yeats’ tower, in all that fakery of ghosts, Some solid women came and slept as Mrs. Yeats’ guests. We are most our own strange selves when we are hosts. Here those who have loved or befriended me came to a proof: They must lodge in my head and in company under one roof. Keeping house is the instinct of love; it is always a little ridiculous. Yet it is with no light welcome we welcome the friends of the house.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
We need the ceremony of one another, meals served, more love, more handling of one another with love, less casting out of those who are not of our own household. ‘This turkey is either not cooked enough or it’s tough.’ The culture is in late imperial decline. The children don’t like dark meat or pepper. They say the mother sometimes deliberately puts pepper on the things the grown-ups like better. Less casting out of those in our own household with whom we disagree. The cat will not hear of cat food, he waves it away. He has seen the big thrush taken from the cold box, dressed and put in the hot. ‘If I set the alarm clock, will you turn on the oven when it goes off?’ then she went off to see the profane dancers of the afternoon. It was done. The fact that I don’t like his pictures should not obscure the facts that he is a good man that many admire his work (his canvases threaten my existence and I hope mine his, the intolerant bastard) that we are brothers in humanity & the art. Often it does, though. The cat has followed Hazard from his studio, he looks mean. He upbraids the innocent dog and all of us, he casts us out. ‘There’s pepper in this gravy. We’re supposed to eat dry turkey and you’ve put pepper in the gravy.’ The meal is served, nevertheless with felt love, some godless benediction. The grown ones have wine after the other bottle. They cast out a lot. ‘The dancers this afternoon were, well, thinky,’ she says. She toys with her glass. ‘He is strictly a one-joke painter,’ he replies, ‘painted that one twenty years ago and is still putting pepper on it, ha hah. Finish your turkey you two and leave a little gravy for someone else.’ The cat is taking notes against his own household. He watches. Hazard would like once to see things with the cat’s eyes, flat. Now it is time to go to bed. Hungry and alone most go to bed in this decline and in all others, yet Someone has fed us again and blessed us with the manners of bohemia. Among barbarians, a lot is expected of us, ceremony-wise. We rise to that expectation.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Touching your goodness, I am like a man Who turns a letter over in his hand And you might think this was because the hand Was unfamiliar but, truth is, the man Has never had a letter from anyone; And now he is both afraid of what it means And ashamed because he has no other means To find out what it says than to ask someone. His uncle could have left the farm to him, Or his parents died before he sent them word, Or the dark girl changed and want him for beloved. Afraid and letter-proud, he keeps it with him. What would you call his feeling for the words That keep him rich and orphaned and beloved?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Outside the hotel window, unenlightened pigeons weave and dive like Stukas on their prey, apparently some tiny insect brother. (In India, the attainment of nonviolence is considered a proper goal for human beings.) If one of the pigeons should fly into the illusion of my window and survive (the body is no illusion when it’s hurt) he could be taken across town to the bird hospital where Jains, skilled medical men, repair the feathery sick and broken victims. There, in reproof of violence and of nothing else, live Mahavira’s brothers and sisters. To this small, gentle order of monks and nuns it is bright Vishnu and dark Shiva who are illusion. They trust in faith, cognition, and nonviolence to release them from rebirth. They think that birds and animals—like us, some predators, some prey— should be ministered to no less than men and women. The Jains who deal with creatures (and with laymen) wear white, while their more enterprising hermit brothers walk naked and are called the sky-clad. Jains pray to no deity, human kindness being their sole illusion. Mahavira and those twenty-three other airy creatures who turned to saints with him, preached the doctrine of ahimsa, which in our belligerent tongue becomes nonviolence. It’s not a doctrine congenial to snarers and poultrymen, who every day bring to market maimed pheasants. Numbers of these are brought in by the Jain brothers and brought, to grow back wing-tips and illusions, to one of the hospitals succoring such small quarry. When strong and feathered again, the lucky victims get reborn on Sunday mornings to the world’s violence, released from the roofs of these temples to illusion. It is hard for a westerner to speak about men and women like these, who call the birds of the air brothers. We recall the embarrassed fanfare for Francis and his flock. We’re poor forked sky-clad things ourselves and God knows prey to illusion—e.g., I claim these brothers and sisters in India, stemming a little violence, among birds.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Limped out of the hot sky a hurt plane, Held off, held off, whirring pretty pigeon, Hit then and scuttled to a crooked stop. The stranger pilot who emerged—this was the seashore, War came suddenly here—talked to the still mechanics Who nodded gravely. Flak had done it, he said, From an enemy ship attacked. They wheeled it with love Into the dark hangar’s mouth and tended it. Coffee and cake for the pilot then who sat alone In the restaurant, reading the numbered sheets That tell about weather. After, toward dusk, Mended the stranger plane went back to the sky. His curly-headed picture, and mother’s and medal’s pictures Were all we knew of him after he rose again, Those few electric jewels against the moth and whining sky.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The alternative to flying is cowardice, And what is said against it excuses, excuses; Its want was always heavy in those men’s bodies Who foresaw it in some detail; and failing that, The rest were shown through its skyey heats and eases In sleep, awoke uncertain whether their waking cry Had been falling fear only, or love and falling fear. When the sudden way was shown, its possibility In terms of the familiar at last shown, (How absurdly simple the principle after all!) Any tyrant should have sensed it was controversial: Instrument of freedom; rights, not Wrights; Danger should never be given out publicly. The men could easily have been disposed of, They and their fragile vehicle. Then the sky Would perhaps have darkened, earth shaken, nothing more. In practice the martyrdom has been quiet, statistical, A fair price. This is what airmen believe. The transition to battle was smooth from here. Who resents one bond resents another, And who has unshouldered earth-restraining hand Is not likely to hear out more reasonable tyrannies. The woods where he died were dark even at sunup, Oak and long-needle pine that had come together Earlier, and waited for the event at the field’s edge. At sunset when the sky behind was gay One had seen the lugubrious shapes of the trees, Bronze and terrible, but had never known the reason, Never thought they were waiting for someone in particular. They took him at night, when they were at their darkest. How they at last convinced him is not known: The crafty engine would not fall for their softness, (Oh, where were you then, six hundred cunning horses?) In the end it had torn hungrily through the brush To lie alone in the desired clearing. Nor the wings; (And you, with your wide silver margin of safety?) They were for the field, surely, where they so often Had eased their load to ground. No, the invitation Must have been sent to the aviator in person: Perhaps a sly suggestion of carelessness, A whispered invitation perhaps to death. He was not badly disfigured compared to some, But even a little stream of blood where death is Will whimper across a forest floor, Run through that whole forest shouting. Him now unpersoned, warm, and quite informal, Dead as alive, raise softly sober interns; Lift gently, God, this wholly airborne one. Leads out all his life to this violent wood. Note that he had not fought one public battle, Met any fascist with his skill, but died As it were in bed, the waste conspicuous; This is a costly wreck and costly to happen on: Praise and humility sound through its siren shrieks, And dedication follows in car. The morning came up foolish with pink clouds To say that God counts ours a cunning time, Our losses part of an old secret, somehow no loss.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tonight Hazard’s father and stepmother are having jazz for McGovern. In the old game-room the old liberals listen as the quintet builds crazy houses out of skin and brass, crumbling the house of decorum, everybody likes that. For decades they have paid for the refurbishing of America and they have not got their money’s worth. Now they listen, hopeful, to the hard rock for McGovern. The ceiling in this palace needs fixing, the chalky blue paint is like an old heaven but there are holes and flaking. They had movies here when grandpa was solvent. Hazard desires his wife, the way people on the trains to the death camps were seized by irrational lust. She is the youngest woman in the room, he would like to be in bed with her now, he would like to be president. He has not been to his studio in four days, he asks the bartender, a college boy with a ponytail, for more gin. He stands in the doorway. Forsythia and lilac have overgrown the porch, there is the rich smell of wood-rot. What twenty years will do to untended shrubbery and America and Hazard.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here at the seashore they use the clouds over & over again, like the rented animals in Aïda. In the late morning the land breeze turns and now the extras are driving all the white elephants the other way. What language are these children shouting in? He is lying on the beach listening. The sand knocks like glass, struck by bare heels. He tries to remember snow noise. Would powder snow ping like that? But you don’t lie with your ear to powder snow. Why doesn’t the girl who takes care of the children, a Yale girl without flaw, know the difference between lay and lie? He tries to remember snow, his season. The mind is in charge of things then. Summer is for animals, the ocean is erotic, all that openness and swaying. No matter how often you make love in August you’re always aware of genitalia, your own and the half-naked others’. Even with the gracefulest bathers you’re aware of their kinship with porpoises, mammals disporting themselves in a blue element, smelling slightly of fish. Porpoise Hazard watches himself awhile, like a blue movie. In the other hemisphere now people are standing up, at work at their easels. There they think about love at night when they take off their serious clothes and go to bed sandlessly, under blankets. Today the children, his own among them, are apparently shouting fluently in Portuguese, using the colonial dialect of Brazil. It is just as well, they have all been changed into small shrill marginal animals, he would not want to understand them again until after Labor Day. He just lays there.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A person is very self-conscious about his head. It makes one nervous just to know it is cast In enduring materials, and that when the real one is dead The cast one, if nobody drops it or melts it down, will last. We pay more attention to the front end, where the face is, Than to the interesting and involute interior: The Fissure of Rolando and such queer places Are parks for the passions and fears and mild hysteria. The things that go on there! Erotic movies are shown To anyone not accompanied by an adult. The marquee out front maintains a superior tone: Documentaries on Sharks and The Japanese Tea Cult. The fronts of some heads are extravagantly pretty. These are the females. Men sometimes blow their tops About them, launch triremes, sack a whole city. The female head is mounted on rococo props. Judgment is in the head somewhere; it keeps sums Of pleasure and pain and gives belated warning; This is the first place everybody comes With bills, complaints, writs, summons, in the morning. This particular head, to my certain knowledge Has been taught to read and write, make love and money, Operate cars and airplanes, teach in a college, And tell involved jokes, some few extremely funny. It was further taught to know and to eschew Error and sin, which it does erratically. This is the place the soul calls home just now. One dislikes it of course: it is the seat of Me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I stand on the ledge where rock runs into the river As the night turns brackish with morning, and mourn the drowned. Here the sea is diluted with river; I watch it slaver Like a dog curing of rabies. Its ravening over, Lickspittle ocean nuzzles the dry ground. (But the dream that woke me was worse than the sea’s gray Slip-slap; there are no such sounds by day.) This crushing of people is something we live with. Daily, by unaccountable whim Or caught up in some harebrained scheme of death, Tangled in cars, dropped from the sky, in flame, Men and women break the pledge of breath: And now under water, gone all jetsam and small In the pressure of oceans collected, a squad of brave men in a hull. (Why can’t our dreams be content with the terrible facts? The only animal cursed with responsible sleep, We trace disaster always to our own acts. I met a monstrous self trapped in the black deep:All these years, he smiled, I’ve drilled at sea For this crush of water. Then he saved only me.) We invest ships with life. Look at a harbor At first light: with better grace than men In their movements the vessels run to their labors Working the fields that the tide has made green again; Their beauty is womanly, they are named for ladies and queens, Although by a wise superstition these are called After fish, the finned boats, silent and submarine. The crushing of any ship has always been held In dread, like a house burned or a great tree felled. I think of how sailors laugh, as if cold and wet And dark and lost were their private, funny derision And I can judge then what dark compression Astonishes them now, their sunken faces set Unsmiling, where the currents sluice to and fro And without humor, somewhere northeast of here and below. (Sea-brothers, I lower to you the ingenuity of dreams, Strange lungs and bells to escape in; let me stay aboard last— We amend our dreams in half-sleep. Then it seems Easy to talk to the severe dead and explain the past. Now they are saying, Do not be ashamed to stay alive, You have dreamt nothing that we do not forgive. And gentlier, Study something deeper than yourselves, As, how the heart, when it turns diver, delves and saves.) Whether we give assent to this or rage Is a question of temperament and does not matter. Some will has been done past our understanding, Past our guilt surely, equal to our fears. Dullards, we are set again to the cryptic blank page Where the sea schools us with terrible water. The noise of a boat breaking up and its men is in our ears. The bottom here is too far down for our sounding; The ocean was salt before we crawled to tears.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

With a dolly and a zoom, the airbus entire Everglades shows us: blotchy cloud-shadows thrown on seepage algae’s overgrown. Observe—the air we freely breathe from this height seems to sheath earth in miasma. The clouds look like dross. The Everglades look like dross. Biomass is, essentially, dross. In Miami, all the gold that could enclose a woman’s finger, wrist, or neck was on display, as if to deflect knowledge of her own mossiness. Pretend not to know what this says about our aspirations to the high life. Up in the airbus, I see as if for the first time how a cloverleaf turns a highway into a motif on the margins of a manuscript illuminated with a wing that tipped itself in asphalt. The story it tells wants unstapling into angels, heavenly bodies drawn raptly in on tail winds, touched with halogen.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Where we’d recently lain, exchanging a kiss, stork consorted with crane, limpkin with ibis. Was this as much wedding as there would ever be, the fowls’ foot-webbing, the identificatory ring around a throat? Exchange of earth and air: not a vow but a vote of confidence a feather might tip by a single scale ... That one’s a raconteur, so much salt in his tale; this one’s a countertenor, lilting above the feast. The archon of his hectare — spotted — spotted least. Here’s a little heckler ... penciled seagull in the margin. Following line by line the path you took, I imagine no print so fine.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Lynette, the stars are kerned so far apart—Through a herniated zodiac I almost see your waled skylanes, your shocked Capricorn and Cancer.In the hundred and two years since you were born, and the sixteen since your heart failed, and the nearly sixty since you gave up poetry, it seems we can’t navigate by the same star chart.I’d like to think we were fated to work the same coracle: you steering with one hand, grasping your corner of the seine while I grasp mine; together sweeping the weirs.Lynette saw the sky made wide-waled corduroy by the flight paths of fighter jets.Corde du roi—“Cloth of the king.”(“A baseless assertion,” states the oed.)A fireman from the Midlands nfs said the raids on Swansea were worse than on Birmingham, where a ten-year-old Roy Fisher gaped at the garden where his cousins were slaughtered, and later wrote, It was like a burst pod filled with clay.Last night, Lynette, my son thought he saw his father in the jumbo jet roaring over Cherryhurst: the weather softer, flight paths altered.Three weeks now his father gone. •Insofar as Moses came to in a coracle, it wasn’t a Welsh one-off; it wasn’t a hapax of vessels.Insofar as it’s kind of a kiddie boat, not a kayak, not the royal barge the Makah sent William Blake, aka Johnny Depp, with into the northern Pacific; not even the Viking ship, its carved prow like an uncial; insofar as it is calico wrapped up in tar, insofar as it is swaddled willow whippets. •“Pastoral ding-dong is out,” Lynette wrote, and no wonder— bombs hidden on the glossy knolls. In the sorrel. In the tormentil.I thought she was perhaps the closest I could get to my grandmother.While Lynette was writing “Displaced Persons”— Neither from the frosted leaf nor from The grey hard ground could they find Relief—Lydia was migrating, on foot, a thousand miles from Minsk to Hanover through the German lines in a different tongue.I only have this tongue, so I adopt Lynette’s epic as a stand-in.She slipped back to childhood in Buenos Aires, garrulous in her dying, her children spiriting a Spanish dictionary into the facil with them on visits.I would see again São Paolo, she wrote (my mother would be reared there): the coffee-colored house with its tarmac roof.I can imagine myself down the same funnel reverting to Portuguese and the small pure word-hoard shared between child and grandparent: suja, limpo, bom, mau, com fome, cansado.Porcaria.Disgraçada!Let my children bring the dictionary too.Lynette was ardent for penillions, and “experimented with a poem on Rain by using all words which had long thin letters....”Maybe you thrill to such things when English isn’t fully naturalized.Hers was a poetry full of metals and alloys; air raids they were, ear raids... •I’m not so much crusted with parasangs, or dipped in leagues, as fried in miles of a journey resembling the arc between Cleo and asp.The jacuzzi, on a timer, sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree afternoon.

\"I thought of you as a butterfly tonight,\" getting to eschatology from a sketchpad, your mom's. And though you write sermons nice and linear you also digress and about-face. The jeroboam trees are dark tonight. Darker in the outage than the stars let the sky be. Partyers all. The abbot told you, \"I do not have power, the archbishop does not have power, the pope does not have power. Only God has power.\" Then it is not a kind of violence to put a photo of the Pope in a luscious hacienda, imperilled by a minature pullbell. Someone admired the hostess's oils. \"Yes, it was a surprise when they hired me to teach but they said, 'We can teach an artist to teach but we can't teach a teacher to be an artist.'\" \"How true,\" the guests murmured. This was not your mother though artists all say it \"comes from somewhere else.\" When another guest compared the Catholic to the Episcopal service she said, \"I think not.\" In a desert once I almost fell off a cliff. To calm me down a friend told a joke: \"Descartes was sitting on a plane. The stewardess said, 'Coffee or tea?' 'I think not,' Descartes said, and vanished.\" It took a moment to sink in because I thought he said \"The cart\" as in \"beverage cart.\" Confusion is the only way to get to eschatology from a sketchpad. I'm trying to redeem that abbot. Drawing in the outage. Once you suggest the origins of music lay in the necessity of drowning out the cries of sacrificial victims, I start listening for them—the cries—under my own singing. Scholars resurrect books all the time just by quoting them. When Roman gods popped out of the soil, the Christians looked around wildly. Sculpt the mouth around \"sculpture,\" ulpt. They reburied them hurriedly, and the earth gulped. The statue of the Commendatore went down with Don Giovanni. Which shall I believe, the unrepentence of the sinkholed Don? Or the statue that converts Leontes by resurrecting his all-forgiving wife? Hermione who's peerless has a likeness; he who won't about-face is not \"mocked by art\" but brought posthaste to hell, his \"shapely seat and heart\". . . The moon slips out like a foreign coin from denim: a drachma, an as. Can we redeem it? Cities are places are conversion, you said. But I am citiless. \"She ascended to the thrown,\" you wrote by mistake, of Elizabeth.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
A levitating anvil. Omen of seagull blown inland. Ranch gate said Riverstyx, but it was the woodland that looked lethal: no place to put down your foot. Bucolics demand boustrophedon. The by-the-book. “The male cicadas thrummed their stomachs while a dragonfly eyed us from a pole hook. Ripening grapefruit. Us just under. Shoulder to shoulder. Tree-shook.” Milky skies belied the baffled thunder ... They left, not footsteps, trails in uncut grass. “Like parallel snakes. No wonder.” Eurydice should have thought moccasins, aka cottonmouths, apropos stealth. Distilled to systole-diastole. Assassins. And everywhere sharp palmettos clacked their tongues in homage to language — “I should have rhymed them with stilettos.” Why would E. shed her red wedge with its Mary Jane band, wetland mosquito and midge circling ankle (punctuated, understand, by the awl, to mimic ellipses ... )? “Because” — O. — “she mimicked the shy strand of epiphyte — Spanish moss — goose-pimpling the languid pond with its dependent clause.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
It is eighty degrees in December. It is he, on one of his furloughs, bringing himself — and hell — up to date.My Don Juan, the better climber (as the mercury yo-yos),is in a newly roused state, the world circumcised away from an out-of-season bud leaving at the scrupulous rim,as it unfurls, a darker appliqué, like O-positive frozen solidat the sight of one’s resuscitated victim. This rosebush assiduously forks over its works where most grandifloras falter, thriving as far into the year as Capricorn.While named after a lover, it decorates its own altarand wields an extraordinary thorn: once I saw it catch a football in those semiquaver quasi-teeth; it is three-headed, like Cerberus,a hybrid drawing bloodlines from a root-ball on hands all that’s impure lies beneath.Hands can train it, barbarous as it is, on an arbor, and I might like to take its thick canes in harness, first pouring cement as a base(so it would know I meant business). Always poised to strike,they eventually undo their stays, baying out like a window of garnet, as at Chartres (torture chamber in its basement,or so I hear). I wonder how such a daemon rose got its start,what fairy tale explains its scent ... And then I go out tonight and find him, swiping right on every pretty face in candlelight.It is almost Christmas. Stacks of square plates. (It’s an open plan.) Racksof bottles. The whites and blacks, clear glass, and stainless steel sieves denote compliance with standards. A wire basket of freckled pearsis transparency; sterilized knives give full disclosure; and as regardsthe stemware, due diligence dares a slip, especially on chanteuses like these salting down from state-of-the-art speakers.

Reaching for the vinegar over the range hood (still dashing grass wisps on the gas flames from the exhaust vent where we booted that brooding sparrow) I remember the rabbit in the Tiergarten that perched on its spatula feet where the grass had just started to green.

i Dear A. — Nailing crockery to the walls was not something I ever understood, but Simonetta’s maiolica falls, like this sideboard, painted wood, under the enchantment of a freehand look — a curling script, a loose grape tendril, the forms that hecatomb smoke took purling to a Roman god’s nostril ... Because geranium is crinkled in the spillage from the wishing well, now outdated and backfilled, this whole place evinces the nature of a souvenir plate. Another tell: the mosquito flourish in its signature.ii The rustic bicycle, like a pen that spent its ink, wrote an invisible sentence to the ramparts and back, now and again rolling through the arches of an aqueduct dowsing with its sixth sense across the hillsides. Locals tucked plastic water bottles under spouts chiseled into lions’ pouts stationed at intervals, like shrines. Their cars idled while they stooped, and on Sundays even formed lines. They trust this water more, Lorenzo whooped, than what comes out of their taps? The sources snake beneath the maps.iii The little terrier Amore, they warned me, had eaten the seat belts; so there I was, my friend, fearing whiplash in the back seat (no headrest either!), in all respects afloat — Simonetta on alert for signs of gallantry, like the wives of those diminished Casanovas who dream they’ve merely grown discreet. And the dissertation she once wrote on courtesan-poetesses, fancying herself of that ilk (“Like me!” — a phrase she’d strew among her compliments) gathers dust on a shelf. When I think of Boccherini’s metacarpals interred beneath the soppressata marbles of the duomo, I think: Casa del Diavolo. Those two.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here I am saying “The leaves are falling” —one of those choruses that vie with interminable verses to mock hoarders. Yeah, we get that a palette of winds is a pretty thing: one blurs the anther, another the river splurging on riprap, expunging phosphates, out of the temperature differential building sculptural fogs that promenade between shores a glacier wedged ajar, a fjord. Whatever gives the river its seriousness reverses in the light of those clouds moving as if absorbing their pomp in advance of it— characters which untied the painter and took the sculls again.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The sky was laced with Irish cream mist, that mellow tan overhanging the hills, which were studded with deathmasks and baskets spilling flowers from both ends. We scanned the haze for lightning. They were studded with earthworks and iron forks inserted between leaves of grass, jacks and bearings and balances, sinuous fingers of pink marble and synovial joints in bronze. But if we got struck by lightning—not a lot; say glanced, or shaved, there was a chance (we heard) it wouldn't be so bad: a little refreshing, a little like La Vita Nuova in a readable translation. \"In a flash,\" as they say, we could acquire a self-renewing subscription to classical music (it's always classical in the scientific literature) accessible at all hours and piped into the forebrain from the hypothalamus. This space available for celebrations. Someone visits for the first time and says, \"Oh, let's get married here\" and guests drive in and eye the hors d'oeuvre tent before finding a folding chair. But it isn't long before the mirroring going on between, for instance, the sculptures and the trees—the trees looking more like sculptures, the sculptures getting seasoned, growing bark (patinas) even—it isn't long before it hypnotizes the guests. Who would wear a wedding dress in such a charged atmosphere, having heard that ghost story of the wedding dress with the power to possess the soul of the bride? Actually it was a horror flick from somewhere, Tokyo or Calcutta . . . It was a wedding dress that took possession of the soul of its bride the minute she saw it in the mirror, or it saw itself—and this we know happens, but not with the malevolence of this dress that wreaked havoc at the reception, set the hall on fire and dropped a crate of champagne on the string trio. \"Aha,\" cries the groom as he realizes the chrysalis of evil he must divide from his bride: \"You are hardly an unruffled surface!\" No you would not want to wear that dress amid the wireless network of gigantic sculptures and their wind-scraped murmuring. When the wind stirs, is it not the gardeners? The gardeners are invisible, they don't garden during business hours. As you'd put a dye in the air in order to see it, a bird sucked through its drafts advertises the invisible and upgrades it to naked.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The hotel showers were splendidly profligate. The aqueduct that fed the big fountains down the street probably ran underneath my bed, giving the water pressure a nice bump. These were veritable circuses of water: crowds pleased to see, qua the wonders of Roman hydraulic engineering, water shatter its own mirror never incurring bad luck. That weird accord of rationality with credulity back of everything; a double consciousness, sticky, with surfacing its principle aesthetic. It was the fountains that helped me remember a spinto’s stratagem of holding her breath for at least four minutes, training herself to dive in, then, if not divadom. Naiads must be, conversely, vocal masters. What do they sing? They sing odes to the Pantheon, whose niches stand empty of the gods that a ray of sun through the oculus goes on splashing with awful clarity on its rounds of the heavens; the architect, Hadrian, was the passionate emperor. Another temple of his, nicked of its storied goddesses roma and amor, put to work the magical properties of palindromes for the good of the state. A pet falcon sacrificed so that its earthly years might be annexed to the emperor’s was a Five-Year Plan; never forget the desk blotter in the administrative office was blood red. I conflate it with the rosebushes at the House of the Vestals. Twice I saw a bride dressed up, toddling in the street, posing for photographs, and if they turn up in Vogue, I won’t be the wiser. On close inspection, those holes that fleck the ancient masonry weren’t made by bullets, but hooks that secured marble. Monumental doors testify to the height of the heroes that walk the earth then disappear. Now what are the odds that the moon in a pellucid cerulean dusk shakes loose as a disc of marble spolia? It’s all a psychic recyclable that seems endlessly up for grabs. The Romans exit doors sideways, like cats flattening themselves on a ledge, then venture boldly into traffic. If a sudden access of quiet obtains, it’s in a square of colossi where executions took place. The windswept expanse is both style and semantics. So, up glaring stairs, in a killing sun, I hazarded my life for a snatched reward at the door handle with brass asps intertwined, under ceilings some painter wanted to strike us all blind with. (“Con forza!”) On the outdoor screens a new horror was unscrolling from America, and conversations with no calls to punish or pray broke out all around me, in English, putting emphasis on pragmatics. What has pragmatics to do with our touristing in the ruins over which a seagull made a W —or was it a bent drill bit, a (sorry) augur?

I teach my friend, a fisherman gone blind, to cast true left, right or center and how far between lily pads and the fallen cedar. Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last? Our bait, worms, have no professors, they live in darkness, can be taught fear of light. Cut into threes even sixes they live separate lives, recoil from light. He tells me, “I am seldom blind when I dream, morning is anthracite, I play blind man’s bluff, I cannot find myself, my shoe, the sink, tell time, but that’s spilled milk and ink, the lost and found I cannot find. I can tell the difference between a mollusk and a whelk, a grieving liar and a lemon rind.” Laughing, he says, “I still hope the worm will turn,pink, lank, and warm, dined out on apples of good fortune. Books have a faintly legible smell. Divorced from the sun, I am a kind of bachelor henpecked by the night. Sometimes I use my darkness well— in the overcast and sunlight of my mind. I can still wink, sing, my eyes are songs.” Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last? He could not fish, he could not walk, he fell in his own feces. He wept. He died where he fell.The power of beauty to right all wrongs is hard for me to sell.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I sing this morning: Hello, hello. I proclaim the bright day of the soul. The sun is a good fellow, the devil is a good guy, no deaths today I know. I live because I live. I do not die because I cannot die. In Tuscan sunlight Masaccio painted his belief that St. Peter’s shadow cured a cripple, gave him back his sight. I’ve come through eighty-five summers. I walk in sunlight. In my garden, death questions every root, flowers reply. I know the dark night of the soul does not need God’s eye, as a beggar does not need a hand or a bowl.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There are places for chaos on the page, meaningful, apparent confusion — temps en temps on the continent does not mean “time to time” in Kent, or Greenwich. From stone through weeds and parchment, through bad times, words made their way to the printed page. Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage, but for those who pray with bare feet, some washed, some smelling of stables and excrement. I’m not sure the words ocean and sea mean the same to you and me. Ninety-five percent universal confusion, dark matter was born with the legitimacy of an onion, the roar of a lion. I sit in the rumble seat of judgment, I damn myself for entertainment, for wasting time on hopeless entertainment. I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian knots in my “Shakespeare” fishing reels. I must untangle this because eels have hearts like us. The enemy is symmetry. In the spring of content, I trust glorious chaos. I smell in disorder the outhouse of order. I must have respect for what I kill and eat, Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat. He added, “Waste nothing you eat,” he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me, or my Father, one person who is three.” Rebecca, at the well, said, “Drink. Water your camels.” I swear, my hands each on a Bible, the only evidence admissible is invisible. At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell. Chaos is not a “sometime thing,” its face and back are turned to and from us, what I cannot see is beautiful, or an isthmus that connects almost nothing to almost nothing — the great unless, either/or. I grab on to metaphor, uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific. The motto I nail to my door:The Devil generalizes, angels are specific. Chaos makes me merry, string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory, romance of the rose, roses that go with any other flower, from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry. From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night: Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night. Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour. I model for myself, I pose in north light. With helpers, his stevedore brothers, Hypnos and Thanatos, Charon still poles his familiar ferry across the Styx to an island where skeletons dance. Einstein said, “I too believe in appearance,” he didn’t think Old One plays dice, takes chances. You bet your bottom dollar the universe rhymes with another universe like verse. Yeats, Herrick, and Herbert would like that. To them, I lift my hat. Delphic chaos is wise, metaphoric thinking multiplies bunches of grapes, by tripod, by butterflies. Chaos is endless longing — God’s pussycat. In Prague, Mozart knew a starling who sang his piano concerto all along, except for one note he always got wrong.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
There’s wondering, idle thoughts, thinking over what was last said, some poetry in my head like traffic outside the window. In my forgetful marrow, I consider often lying words, like everything and all.Nothing is another matter. Nothing comes of everything and all. Something comes of nothing. I know the word no means no,yes, yes, except when they mean each other. There’s water, which means water,dishwater, that may mean worthless. It’s often better to say worthless when you mean it. I’ve come to meaning, that can meanreason for or reason to live, words I might say outright without first saying meaning. Then there is a mean man. How did mean come to have two meanings? Take a dictionary of homonyms and tell me how words got to sound alike with different meanings and spellings, a Sea of Words which is a Chinese dictionary. Language has its ways, its altitude and latitude ... Stanley, baby, quit jerking on and off. I’m simply talking to myself. I am more familiar with the dark night and bright day of the body than the dark night of the soul. Light has an exaggerated reputation. Goethe’s last words were, “Mehr Licht!” Faust was dragged off to hell when he was content. Goethe preferred discontent, which needed light. The seed is contained discontent.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In Canada, on a dark afternoon, from a cabin beside Lake Purgatory I saw your two clenched fists in a tree— your most recent rage—until I came to my senses, and saw two small lighted glass lamps reflected through a window onto the maple leaves. Was it simply that I had stolen away in the wilderness to go fishing on your birthday, twelve years after your death, and you less than your rusty pliers in my fishing box? It is late August in the moral North. To answer your first question, I obey the fish and game laws of New York State, Ontario and Quebec. The odd branch has already turned red. As for me I have turned inside out, I cry for revolution against myself— no longer red, I’m parlor pink and gray, you, less than a thumb print on a page. Matters still outstanding: you will not remember— a boy, I cut school, sneaked out to the 42nd Street library to read among readers like a stray lion cub taken into a great pride. I have kept your Greek grammar, your 78 revolutions per minute recording of Rossini’s Barber you played to stop me from crying, almost my first memory. Your “valuable papers,” now valuable only to me, I fed to a fire years ago. Frankly I am tired of receiving letters from the dead every day, and carrying you on my back, out of the burning city, in and out of the bathroom and bedroom, you less than the smoke you wanted for a shroud. Let us dance with Sarah behind the curtain where God in his divine humor tells Abraham Sarah will at ninety bear a son, and she asks laughing within herself, “Will I have pleasure?” Take one foot, then the other … Imitate a departure if you make it not, and each going will lend a kind of easiness to the next. Father, you poisoned my father. I am standing alone, telling the truth as you commanded. (Without too many of the unseemly details, like the sounds of you in bed sucking, I thought, on fruit I later would not eat.) You, less than a seed of a wild grape. Today, in the last moments of light I heard a fish, a “Musky,” your nickname, break water. As I sing my song of how you will be remembered, if I could out of misericordia, I’d tie you to the mast and stuff your ears with wax. I regret some parts of the body forgive, some don’t. Father, do not forget your 18 inch Board of Education ruler on which I measured my penis, marking its progress. You kept it on your desk before you till your old age. One reason, perhaps, for the archaic Greek smile I wore on my face through boyhood. I never thought I’d dig your grave with laughter.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The first thing I did against my will is see light. Older, in my mother’s belly with a good mind, I sometimes dreamed different kinds of darkness. I kicked, had sweet dreams and nightmares something like death, unborn happiness, blind hallucinations, memories I can’t name that still push me to act with unborn hands, all before breathing. What last thing will cross my mind after last rights and wrongs? They say the grand finale is like sleep, I may feel love’s nuts and bolts unscrewing — it’s best to be held tight. A pillow does not kiss. May I never waver in peaceful unmindfulness. I’ve seen passionate suffocation, I’ve felt exquisite pain. Far better doggerel: “Nurse, nurse, I’m getting worse!” Undone, I’d like my last thoughts to rhyme: I did not lend you my love. The end.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Day is carved in marble, a man reclining, a naked giant suffering. Preoccupied Day faces Night, who is a woman, huge, naked, Herculean, both pillowed on their uncarved rough marble bed. They need light to be seen, neither has anything to do with the sun or moon. Art is not astronomy, but the heavens are useful as gardening to poets, not useful as love or loneliness. If I write out of arrogance and ignorance a poem called Day, my chisel and mallet, words and pen, paper my marble, I must not confuse sunlight and Day, petals with hours. I could rhyme, perhaps by reason and chance describe the nature of Day. I might discover Nature is surprisingly sometimes moral, unexpected, a principle over which the lovers Night and Day quarrel. In my poem, faithful Night and faithful Day quarreled; rhyme told me they quarreled because Day is gold, Night hates the thought of celestial money, rages at the starless differences between cost and price. Michelangelo did not choose to make a sculpturePrezzo, or put the finger of God on a coin. Day and Night saw Danaë’s legs spread apart for Zeus to enter as a shower of gold. They are not household gods or saints. Better I write about things nearby, a chair, a stool, the principle I’m sitting on. Day is my dictionary. If my Day were animal, he might be a baby elephant who eats leaves. My good Day stays close to his mother, who is murdered for her ivory tusks. My Day is an endangered specie. I whisper into elephant ears, peace, my darling little Day. An owl hoots, your Day has no given name! True, I refuse names useful to many others: Sabbath, Sunday, Friday, Saturday. My Day is not baptized, circumcised, or blessed. I pick him up and hold Day in my arms. I put my head in Day’s open mouth. I tongue Day, and Day tongues me. Yes, although my Day loves Night, he tongues me in and out of bed. My Day knows Night carnally, lets Night know me. So I love Day today. And I love Night tonight.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I said, “Nothing for the last time.” You said, “Everything for the last time.” Later I thought you made everything more precious with “everything for the last time”: the last meditation, the last falling asleep, the last dream before the final makebelieve, the last kiss good night, the last look out the window at the last moonlight. Last leaves no time to hesitate. I would drink strong coffee before my last sleep. I’d rather remember childhood, rehearse forgiveness, listen to birdsong or a Spanish housemaid singing, scrubbing a tiled floor in Seville— I’d scrub and sing myself. O SusannaSusanna, quanta pena mi costi. I would strangle the snakes of lastness like Herakles in his crib before I cocked my ear to Mozart for the last time. There is not sky or clouds enough to cover the music I would hear for the last time. I know a bank whereon the wild thyme of everything for the last time grows, covered with deadly nightshade and poison hemlock. No last, no first, thinking in the moment, years ago, you prepared the soil in Hawaii before you planted your palm trees, then shared most of your days and nights with them as equals. You built your house with a Zen room. I made no prayer when I dug a hole and pushed in a twelve-foot white pine, root ball locked in green plastic netting. I did not cut the netting, so twenty years later a tall, beautiful, white pine died. I lynched the roots. To save my life I would let them seize, cut out a bear’s heart, I would partake in its flesh. But you would die before you’d let them kill that bear. Again, I say, “Nothing for the last time.” You say, “Everything for the last time.” Sailor, I would have killed a stranger to save the world. Sailor, you would not. We kissed goodbye on the cheek. I hope not for the last time. Home, I look into my brass telescope— at the far end, where the moon and distant stars should be, I see my eye looking back at me, it’s twinkling and winking like a star. I go to bed. My dogs, donkeys and wife are sleeping. I am safe. You are home with your wife you met and decided to marry in four days.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. Snow clouds shadow the bay, on the ice the odd fallen gull. I try to keep my friend from dying by remembering his childhood of praise to God, who needs us all. Würzburg: the grownups are inside saying prayers for the dead, the children are sent out to play—their laughter more sacred than prayer. After dark his father blesses and kisses him Güttenacht. He wakes to go to school with children who stayed behind and were murdered before promotion. Now his wife lies beside him. He may die with her head on his pillow. He sings in his sleep: “Her breasts are white sheep that appear on the mountain, her belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.” Awake, he says, as if telling me a secret: “When metaphor and reality come together, death occurs.” His life is a light, fresh snow blowing across the bay.2. A year later in Jerusalem, he carries a fallen soldier on his back, himself. The text for the day begins: “He slew a lion in the pit in a time of snow” Seconds, minutes, hours are flesh, he tells me he is being cut to pieces— if they had not made him turn in his rifle … He sees I can not bear more of that. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of hands in sleep and we drink to life. Chilled in desert heat, what keeps him alive: soldiers—his wife, his son and daughter, perhaps the ashes of a girl he loved in childhood. Outside their window a Sun Bird and Dead Sea Sparrow fly from everlasting to everlasting. Later he covers my head with his hands, blessing me, later unable to walk alone he holds onto my hand with so much strength he comforts me.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Today in Rome, heading down Michelangelo’s Spanish Steps, under an unchanging moon, I held on to the balustrade, grateful for his giving me a hand. All for love, I stumbled over the past as if it were my own feet. Here, in my twenties, I was lost in love and poetry. Along the Tiber, I made up Cubist Shakespearean games. (In writing, even in those days, I cannot say it was popular to have “subjects” any more than painters used sitters. But I did.) I played with an ignorant mirror for an audience: my self, embroiled with personae from Antony and Cleopatra. Delusions of grandeur! They were for a time my foul-weather friends— as once I played with soldiers on the mountainous countryside of a purple blanket. 2002@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Good morning, electorate. We are on good speaking terms but do not speak, which means we must be self-reliant, there are many matters at hand. We’re not close enough to know each other’s good news, bad news, private matters. There are silent streets off public gardens for intimacy and come-what-mays. There is library silence and deadly silence that is a private matter. There is happiness written in white and silent writings, meters overheard. Silent are the voices I no longer hear — after the first word spoken I’d recognize who’s there. There is a playwright’s staging called “business,” silent instructions without dialogue, and the silence that says, “none of your business,” but I have an office, a religion, that holds me responsible for everything. I hardly lift a finger to stop the slaughtering. It’s a little like putting a nickel or a dime in a cup and writing this against death, raking leaves against the changing seasons. My memory is like the first sound picture,The Jazz Singer. I am screening: it must have been October, 1927, I remember skipping along Liberty Avenue, before I learned to dance, I sang, “Hoover in the ashcan, Smith in the White House.” Later in Catalonia I danced the Sardana — with its opening and closing circles that made free and equal the young and old, while the soulful tenora, a revolutionary woodwind, played the dance forbidden by Generalissimo Franco. Further back again toward first silences — alone in the Charleville of my den, I smoked Rimbaud’s clay pipe, I thought “I will never die.” I’m simply telling the impossible truth that made my later studies more difficult. When I first shaved my fake oxtail beard invented by Cervantes, I fought back day-reasoning without understanding such dreams were my squire. I returned with Sancho to Granada, my forefathers’ home, my forbearers’ caves,banderillas in the bull’s neck of my mind. When I was young and difficult, Lorca’s photo near my bed, I saw Twelfth Night, sang Mozart arias, read history textbooks my father wrote. Loyalist, I shot fascists, not Iroquois. I found an old photo of Belmonte, the matador born with deformed legs — he stood so close to the bull the beast had to charge around him. His sword in a cape of silence, he stood erect, motionless, a gypsy in a suit of lights tailored by Goya.Interval.... Intermission.... I visited a zoo of languages on the soon-to-be-sunk Statendam, in February touring the Mediterranean with my parents, from the pillars of Hercules to the Bosphorus. In Barcelona, I sided with the brave bull who entered the ring deceived, never having seen a man off a horse, the bull, however noble, sure of death.• I want my work to have the “taste of self”: In the bright, silent mornings of my soul, I refuse my royalties: a bull’s ears, tail, and severed foot. God does not ride a horse, Jesus preferred donkeys. I feed my donkeys carrots, play them operas. A trio, they bray with joy. Because it’s common sense I make noise for the Lord. He wants our kind to read, sing, speak to each other, to rejoice and play to beat the band, horns, drums, bawdy noisemakers. We should give Him the time of day, among sounds, unhearable, bang away, weep with the uncountable suffering others. Among the multitudes, in the swarms, the schools, the hives, rejoice, boo, snore, make noise for the love of noise and questioning, praise Him on Doomsday, He hears the noise of all the world’s blinking eyes. I believe to live as a silent flower is worthwhile. I cannot speak the languages of trees better than birds, who out of gratitude and affection learn arboreal grammar, accents, pronunciation, whatever the weather, but I try because I love a good oak — still, I cannot better the birds ... “Affection” for my neighbor is easy, “love” difficult. Silence can be affection, silence a perfect herald. Still there is speechless love and silent conversations called gestures, helping hands, sometimes only a loving telephone call. There are equators, latitudes, and longitudes of silence, useful com@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
I have not used my darkness well, nor the Baroque arm that hangs from my shoulder, nor the Baroque arm of my chair. The rain moves out in a dark schedule. Let the wind marry. I know the creation continues through love. The rain’s a wife. I cannot sleep or lie awake. Looking at the dead I turn back, fling my hat into their grandstands for relief. How goes a life? Something like the ocean building dead coral.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. Aging, I am a stowaway in the hold of my being. Even memory is a finger to my lips. Once I entered down the center aisle at the Comédie Française, the Artemis of Ephesus on my arm, all eyes on her rows of breasts and me. “Who is this master of her ninety nipples?” the public whispered. Now the ocean is my audience, I see in secret my last secret.2. Mid-December, my old felt hat that I could have imagined myself leaving behind in a restaurant for eternity blew out into the Atlantic. The damn thing so familiar I saw myself wearing it even into the deep, an aging Narcissus, in white foam and northern sunlight, on my way to becoming a conch. It is like seeing music this growing from flesh and bone into seashell: undulating salts become a purple mantle, and the almost translucent bivalve of memory and forgetting closes.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The thing written is a sexual thing, may bite, tell a truth some have died for, even the most casual initialing is a touch of love and what love goes for. A sometime thing, it smiles or has an ugly grin, on the page or wall may be holy and a sin. Writing wants, must have, must know, is flesh, blood, and bone, proof we are not made to be alone. Beneath a dove and rainbow some bank their fire, wrap their erogenous zones in barbed wire. Writing may dance in ink flamenco, kneel before the cross, right wrongs, fall in love at first sight, honor the naked languages it holds tight, kidnap, suck or be sucked for hire, may look and look or sneak a look, it has eyes, can read, is remarkable. From the tower of sexual babble, when dreams were the beginning of writing, the angel of dreams descended, stair by stair, the stone watchtower became the first stone book. Writing never speaks word, may ache to talk, and yet each letter of any alphabet is a fragment of desire, like half and quarter notes on a staff, or a hawk, may swoop down, fly higher and higher to catch a word, and then another word. The sexual thing may be all love or malice, eunuchs writing in the Forbidden Palace where poets dressed in rags, or silk and lace. The thing written touches, kisses, cuddles, may be democratic, autocratic, medieval in the 21st century, feudal, imperial, animal, sexually digital, a Serf, a King, a Queen,la chose écrite est une chose sexuelle. I had a woman beautiful as the letter l. There is the passion of letters, each may mean another thing, be defaced, after a while. Writing leans forward, there is a certain optimism in the written word, a sexual sunrise that is not daybreak. Words, words, a carnival of wordplay on St. Nobody’s Day. Reader, look, there is an S, a snake on the cross of the letter T. The letter of love is still the open-legged V. How can I dot the i with humanity?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The piano has crawled into the quarry. Hauled In last night for firewood, sprawled With frozen barrels, crates and sticks, The piano is waiting for the axe. Legless, a black box, still polished; It lies on its belly like a lizard, Droning, heaving, hardly fashioned For the quarry’s primordial art. Blood red: his frozen fingers cleft, Two on the right hand, five on the left, He goes down on his knees to reach the keyboard, To strike the lizard’s chord. Seven fingers pick out rhymes and rhythm, The frozen skin, steaming, peels off them, As from a boiled potato. Their schemes, Their beauty, ivory and anthracite, Flicker and flash like the great Northern Lights. Everything played before is a great lie. The reflections of flaming chandeliers— Deceit, the white columns, the grand tiers In warm concert halls—wild lies. But the steel of the piano howls in me, I lie in the quarry and I am deft As the lizard. I accept the gift. I’ll be a song for Russia, I’ll be an étude, warmth and bread for everybody.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
In fresh snow that fell on old snow I see wild roses in bloom, springtime, an orchard of apple and peach trees in bloom, lovers of different preferences walking naked in new snow, not shivering, no illusion, no delusion, no bluebells. Why should I live by reality that murders? I wear a coat of hope and desire. I follow fallen maple leaves abducted by the wind. I declare I am a Not Quite, almost a nonentity. I fought for that “almost.” I lift up and button my collar of hope. I simply refuse to leave the universe. I’m all the aunts in my father’s house and all my uncles too. I had fifty great-great-grand-grandmothers who got to Paradise, like Enoch, without dying. Once my friends and I went out in deep paradise snow with Saint Bernards and Great Pyrenees to find those lost in the blizzard that God made for Himself because He prefers not seeing what happens on earth. With touch He can hear, taste, smell, see, and He has fourteen other senses there are no words for. Memory, He said, is a sense, not a power. Who am I to disagree with Him? There are some vegetarians among you, so I will tell you what He eats. It’s green, and cows and sheep eat it too. He picks His teeth. I think I heard Him say, “Gentlemen don’t void in swimming pools or the ocean. I like your dirty jokes, I prefer them in meter.” He told me to carry on. I thought “On” was a Norse god. He said, “No, it’s just a burden that gets heavier, the burden makes you stronger.” “Isn’t on the Japanese debt to ancestors?” I countered. He resents hearing the prayers and praise of sycophants. “How come you are speaking to me?” I asked. He speaks Silence, languages I call “Night” and “Day.” His politics? “Nations” to Him are “a form of masturbation.” Original blasphemy amuses Him, describes His coitus with living creatures, mothers, His self, a whale, a male praying mantis dying to mate. He likes to hear, “do unto others what you would not want others to do unto you.” Instead of a prayer rug, I stitch Him a pillow of false proverbs: “in the house of the hangman talk of rope.” I asked Him if I ever did anything he liked. “You planted eggplant too close to the cucumbers and they married. I blessed that wedding, sent roses by another name.” “How come you speak to me?” I asked. He said He was not speaking to me, “Consult Coleridge on the Imagination.” He waved, He did not say goodbye.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Days of the ferret, a sweet fever. Someone is walking through the sun With my tongue on a leash. Say “Ahhh.” Thank goodness, It’s not diabetes or the Bolivian Rot. This morning I am a cross Between lefthandedness And pointblank rage. The sun leaks like soft ice. The infection deepens . . . My eyes dissolve In a closet of heat. I become 4,000 Yellow flowers, chirruping. O the cliché of a trek into the bowels of China. O the night that zings like a harpsichord factory! O gorgeous sun limping in the frozen dusk. O candy wrappers stacked like bricks! Snow growls on my roof. The infection deepens . . . A day on fire Placing real rabbits Where my mouth should be. I am several kinds of tigers. I am a confectionary treat. This fever fills my sleeves With pearls of honey drops. Am I too strange to bleed? I’m behind myself With a knife and fork, Revolving on a skewer. I am wild with grief As greasy children Reach deep into my fever To scoop out their revenge In double-dips . . . Come off it, kids. Next week, I’ll be raining On the iron road to Malta And perfect health, melting Like sugar in the mouth of the Orinoco.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. In the land of milk and cream delivered early and daily, and always in glass bottles, we care about good grooming and, of course, news of slurs and curs ... Can it really be that home becomes a place to be stranded? “I don’t see a single storm cloud anywhere in the sky, but I can sure smell rain,” out on the edge of Crawfordsville, Indiana, where the answers and questions become identical as evil twins. 2. Basketball ghosts bounce and sweat again in that second-floor gym in the middle of July— that never-to-be-forgotten home of the first-ever Boys State Championship. Rusty jump shots and long-ago corner hooks rim out in a stream of dusted sunlight. “Just to play the game, don’t you know, you know, no matter how much the sacrifice ... ” How searing afternoon’s vagueness now, dreamed in a daylong haze of headache pills downed at the General Lew Wallace Motor Lodge: how the arc of the ball rises to echoes of split-jump cheers in lubricated air, when phantom bodies strive and leap and go prostrate to that squeak of rubber on polished wood— in a game of shirts and skins. 3. You can only wonder how Ezra Pound dissected his time here, among tractors and proctors and temples of antebellum style, as he cooed sweet Greek in the ear of his secular Madonna ... Just now, two pigeons greet first daylight on the Green of Wabash College. Something to be said for being scandalized silly, and in more than one language when life becomes holier than the Crusades. And what’s more—didactic passions eventually drive you insane, thinks young EP, so what? Sew buttons, ha! And make it new always ... and always leave the door cracked open, a light on, and one foot on the floor. 4. “The meatloaf here’s not very good,” warns waitress Lucy, a pretty girl with a tooth missing. Indifferently, day proceeds utterly. Off Country Road X-10, out by Carcus Creek, driving past Minnie Betts’s florist shop and what’s left of the old city jail, you figure each small detail adds glory to any story. “Relax,” says Elton Bidwell, the county’s dead-buzzard collector, “I’ll take care of us all when we com’ on home.” 5. The town goes dark in a killer storm. Collective forgetting and forgiving occurs. But safety comes in many forms. In this vast black you get to thinking about giddy joys and little sorrows, the curse of full employment at minimum wage, and those conspicuous professors— their bowties and braces speaking to the ages and marking moments of learned unworthiness. Maybe, it’s vacuum-packed fear in a stage-managed town. Time to guess what’s behind each tiny crime and local leer, at once rancorous and baffling. Strangers need not apply. A few lights click on at the Shortstop Grille. These cruel weathers turn asphalt slick. The old intramurals begin again. 6. Early Sunday morning and a drunken Elton Bidwell is strung like a scarecrow on his front porch swing, deposited by Grand Wizards from the Odd Fellows Lodge bar late last night—reminder to those devoted folks heading up Church Street with songbooks in hand, that home sure proves just another place to be stranded.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Love While nothing satisfies, not morning’s Bleary mirror or the slick embrace at hand, Consider our mutual jewel an untouching, a pouring Into sweet emptied arms called worth and habit. Hey, you there, change of mind, eh? So, it is these comic-book poses that promise Softer years, quite bearable as amnesia or sex.Sex Tough talkers, their brain-pans fried black From a constant heat, turn out swell On the boulevard strolling in evening wear. Appearances being unavoidable As the urge to keep tuned, even stars Seems to itch for more, for a squeeze Of all our drizzling nothings, save time.Time Leaning out from this wayside planet, You witness another life blown like glass Without pattern or fatuous secret, Yet a limited edition of uncertain radius. Presume then to be home, a part dismantled By continuity; some guiding light Phasing on and off like an unoriginal religion.Religion Get far up and hard in the hole Between dead of winter skies and beyond Limits of ourselves documented by precinct, Greeted cordially by scandal. Too soon Allegiance becomes resistance and otherwise; Meanwhile, after a holy pinch in the ass You are often saved and, perhaps, in love.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
One marriage, three children, the usual hero-to-hump tale of jobs in alternating altitudes, stories of unrequited joy. Fresh identities, dramas unseen. Too much of dawn going dark, making for a rich meal of dread, when contemplating love above the brim. You also should talk about dealings with heavy weather and one-night agonies, as if descending permanently into a single distinction. It boils to skin and plain whim, or any fabrication sufficient to implicate the act. Just then, something glimpsed from a taxi careening through Paris, afterimages of a lost father’s face becomes a tree in the park, tall, rustling with allusions, or was it simply cool air stealing across your face— that isolation again?@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Leaving A backbone of lights Behind me, a blinking string Of pelts in fox country, I long to slice through Connecticut’s middle, marbled And pink as medium-rare beef. I dream you.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
You hear the roadhouse before you see it, Its four-beat country tunes Amplified like surf through the woods, Silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk, Setting beards of moss dancing On dim, indeterminate trees That border two-lane blacktop. Docked tonight, you reveal the badge Of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin Where cap shades face, babyhood Pallor above the sun-blackened jaw Bulging uneasy with a concrete grin And some inevitable need to weep. Don’t you think we live and breathe In the meantime, in lockstep With dawn, sunset, brawling dawn? Even now, you await secrets worse Than the few known ways a seized sky Will come to survive your pity. But on another far field, celebrated For its arrivals and evictions, you learn To be beautiful, never leading A sensible life, playing ball in the early dark, Fighting for a taste of the sweet spot, In this uncut land, this straight-edged air. Whadya want to know that isn’t yet a mystery Somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat Lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown? So it is that later you track high above Familiar tamarack and ash, beginning The next inaccuracy alone, and again, Remembering that everything east of you Has already happened, on the same cold ground, In a swarm of time, finally spiked home To your surprise, nails flung to the air. And us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks You hear from the roadhouse before you see it.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1. Morning of Crystal This is the deathless body, and this the land’s blood … and here the wine-laced sky over Iowa resembles a heavenly parfait. In one more day Des Moines will be diapered by first snow. A young girl, barely real, glazes the sidewalk with a stupid look. Iowa in winter always dumbfounds the love in us. Before long, nothing opposes the weight and resolution of this sky, this wilderness of earth hardening. When heaviness strikes like a clock glowing incandescently, the season opens to itself, as if a familiar stunt in a traveling show, a fabulation only a touched young girl can devise for any new world. Des Moines. November 19732. Cooking the Cold In our smoke house, in hot fog of hickory and buckeye chips, we hang meats like vignettes, independent of all but the bones we crack and soup. Outside, it’s the same white shimmering Ohio country we trust like an open palm, like an apothecary. And in these crosswinds, as our fire builds, stirrings of primordial dusk begin fogging in. Shelby County, Ohio. December 19743. Ice Finesse Long Christmas evening in a farm woman’s bed, I warm like a quilt. A December of junctions, dark, unlittered, airy as entry into fable, cutting against grains of propriety. We are decent enough, naked in the self-paintings we brush like hair. On holy night, waking to the screech of pipes bursting in winter’s elaborate dwelling, our spines ice us upright, like posts in the sheets. Assured of disaster, we fall back to swarm over the gifts from our polished skins. Independence, Missouri. December 19754. The Certainties Kept animals stray in the wind-driven snow twenty miles northwest Out of Minneapolis, white-faced heifers each searching the eyes Of the others, doomed. These distances blowing closed over roads And county fences, emanate from the hardest parts of us like certainties. At desolate junctures, hardly moving, a gunshot of breath signals The residue of soul. On this barren, narrow towpath, the hung Bellies of cows lunge through drifts forming whale tracks, inching Ahead, the beasts hopeful as drifters at the hiring gate. Night-hammered, Blizzard-ripe, we wait by the window with house plants, our fears Nearly realized, a salt lick of faith turning to stone in our bowels. Coon Rapids, Minnesota. January 19765. An Undoing My horses are dead, but the hail has gone. Three hundred miles south the ground is fit to plant. I rinse out in a wind, dreaming of lumber. Logs and dead crops appear in my songs. In this looseleaf country, I can bury and build. Rightly, it is winter. I won’t need more horses. Shelby County, Indiana. February 19776. On the Upside On Hubbard Street, among factory signs And the gay bars further west, this winter In the ditch does not mean enough. With innocence, a melodrama of duty Is played by the big Pole city workers, Flinging rock salt, unplugging sewers In defense of a surprise freeze. Their smiles, like habits, break hard. Their black stocking caps appear Stark and vulnerable to the young men cruising Past hand-in-hand, swimming at noon Toward darkened theaters and bargain hotels, Requiring sweet ambush, a ration Of luxury. These filthy buildings don’t care, Can’t whistle insults. Soon the Poles, Immutable as mud, will have picked These streets clean of ice And loitering glances, will filter Home to dinners of wurst and bock beer, Laying odds against more snow. And slowly, in its timeliness, a clothesline Of color will string through the city, Flapping proudly, ready for collision With high blue skies, like old lovers Tossing again in a warehouse loft, straining free. Northside Chicago. March 1978@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1 Slime burlap on timbers riverside, yea More captive berths to consider: boundaries Set by familar propositions Of comfort and flatbottom mud. We men Haul up some miracle of a ditch To what’s called Squaw Island. And such remains the canalman’s trade At last. Harsh ways, we tell you, Woman, your eyes and rapture averted To the long boats pulled in tandem To your door. How could we see then How it was always us alone— Unknown stations in need of poor launch? 2 If they could sing or even listen A little, we’d be lost deep in the pitch And rumble of real lives, primed To unload a pledge or two of return. One day, under the shadow of hawks, We locked in the long grass As if slugs. The aftermath was quick Parting, forever maybe, then back To our stories of the packet boat Whacking through tangle reeds And the stoop-backed Irish turning mythic In this, a speechless country, Almost mysterious as perfume itself. 3 Captivated at Little Falls, gone clean By Weedsport, pressing toward Those vainglorious times up in Lowertown Where we’d stroll the day, liquor In hand, waiting a turn at the Locks. It should be allowed as how girls Were not forgotten, either. Sure In any faint light setting off-island, You see the hair’s worn from their legs By woolen trousers. Odd why Such standard gossip keeps us Huddled around cigar smoke and fun, Ever shuffling, ready again to move soon. 4 After miles of stumps and clear-cut skies, More stumps. And the deadly matter Of building country in the calm of summer Burdens like a search for much worse. Thinking through a warm afternoon rain, Thinking of getting there, downwater Toward neglect for glory’s sake And other never-lasting bounty, A blessing, it seems, becomes this— All passages so unworldly hot As to be bitter, our own massive bones Sweating. O Motherly touch and need, What have we to do with thee? 5 Just nervous, and the skirtless brides Seem just the same. At the taking Of shore, there’s care for the prize Portraiture of a girl at sixteen in your vest, Driving you mad, and on. It’s a gravity In the blood, unchangeable as the waif You are, a dwarf among dwarfs, no force. They tell you they understand. So half The time so drunk as to see, you wear Your life like a bandanna. That’s all Nobody’s business. That’s all the secret There is. But to any woman’s edges, Rubbed soft as landscape, you are less. 6 Kissing that last sure drop of sweat From a heavy lip, tongues wag easy In this good composted land Amid mire and flesh, a threat of snow. We rise from a hut born To game and holiday, knowing barely Ourselves. None of us escape The terrible progress we make Suffering yet another pleasure. Sad, say, the ways we loved like stones— No courting dance, no feathers Or gesture. But then nobody asked For more than favors or strange luck. 7 They watch for clouds. Any muster Could ruin business, however damp Already the shining caves that bristle Like pearl in moonlight. Beneath their belts The sources of circumstance and invention Turn nightfall to a wash. Lacking A westerly push toward Erie, the hide Tingles for a pressure, a sign, If only the whine of a full day’s water Lost to Niagara. In fair time, The swell might thicken and warm As soup in the casual hands Of a visitor aging to unwelcome weathers. 8 So it’s Buffalo: gutspill and sideshow, Crusade of rascals swaggering Up Front Street. Lovey, it all passes forth— The heart’s infirmities, our grinding Labors .... Who hasn’t spent a life Making civilization right and not Gone wrong? Soon there’ll be other empires, Then farther west, further refinements Of the breed. We conclude here, A rainy frontier, end of a pity. What’s more? Ah, dreaming, we’d scheme of strangers Above our sorry place, wise builders erecting Able love some hundred years hence! 9 Like a hatch of horseflies streaming Into gray light, we’ve grown free to cross The flushing river on abundant piping Of sludge. Where’s the barrelhouse, The waste of laughter and bile that releases? Instead there’s a world piled on bedrock, A history fail@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
